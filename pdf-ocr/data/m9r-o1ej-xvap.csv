Wildlife habitats must be protected in the U.S so that multiple species can thrive in healthy ecosystems that indigenous populations have co-existed with for millennia. I therefore also urge NOAA to make the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary.
 
The designation will much better protect 134 miles of coastline and would encompass more than 5,600 square miles of water off of the Central California coast. It would also advance President Biden's ""America the Beautiful Initiative,"" which is very much welcomed by so many of us people nationwide as it will support locally led conservation efforts across the country with a goal to conserve and restore 30 percent of U.S. lands and waters by 2030. This U.S. step would also help us meet our obligations as part of the similar global initiative.

I am writing as a private citizen in support of the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary (CHNMS). 

My support for this designation is based on the following items:

•	The CHNMS will protect a unique area of consistent upwelling. This upwelling lifts nutrients from deep ocean toward surface waters, providing food and sustenance for marine life. Critically, this area of upwelling is a part of whale migrations along the west coast of the United States. The upwelling also provides nutrients to species who live in the area year-round, as well as species living across the other 4 National Marine Sanctuaries (NMS) along the California coastline. We need to protect this area of upwelling, in order to:
o	Protect the species reliant on the upwelling as a source of nutrients
o	Protect the ecosystem value of the species in the area, and across the other NMS along the California Coast 
o	Protect economic value of this coastline as an attractor of tourism – those who come out to do whale tours, sea otter tours, diving, sport fishing, etc.

•	The City of San Luis Obispo (SLO), and the surrounding area of California’s Central Coast, relies on both tourism and agriculture as primary drivers of their economy. The CHNMS will support both tourism and local agriculture:
o	The Tourism Board of SLO already leans on coastal imagery and attractions to attract visitors to the area. Protecting the waters around the region are integral to ensuring visitors have a safe and exciting tourism experience, and will provide the SLO region greater opportunities for economic development. 
o	Agriculture is key to SLO & surrounding areas economic success. Successful agriculture is reliant on healthy land & air, and existing within a stable ecosystem. We know climate change is an imminent threat to current agricultural practices, particularly in area like SLO which will become notably hotter & drier. Our marine environments are key carbon sinks, and protective mitigating factors against the threat of climate change. By protecting our marine environments, we can take a small but important step to protecting our agricultural activity and concurrent economic activity. Additionally, the immediate proscriptions against offshore oil & gas drilling associated with the CHNMS provide immediate benefits to protecting local air quality, and thus local surface water quality as well. 

•	Designating the CHNMS enables specialised teams & initiatives associated with the NMS program to operate across this stretch of coast. In particular, the Whale Entanglement Team and the Blue Whales & Blue Skies initiative.

•	Designating the CHNMS would provide a model of a collaborative framework for Tribal Governments & Indigenous Communities to work with NOAA going forward.  This is a unique opportunity to leverage collected wisdom and knowledge of local Indigenous people to collaborate on developing resources in area of research, education, and environmental protection. Additionally, designation will provide protections to ancient Sacred Sites offshore.

•	I am disappointed the Agency-preferred boundaries do not include the Morro Bay area, immediately south of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary (MBNMS) boundary. Understanding this area is left out in order to construct undersea transmission cables for off-shore wind electricity generation, I hope & expect this area will fall under Sanctuary protection, either CHMNS or MBNMS immediately following construction of the transmission cables.

The Northern Chumash Tribal Council's role as stewards is of paramount importance. Their ancestral connection to the land and waters provides an unparalleled understanding of the area's intricate balance. Their centuries-old wisdom, cultural heritage, and commitment to sustainability make them the best custodians of the sanctuary. Their stewardship ensures that preservation efforts are infused with respect for tradition, ecological balance, and a holistic view of the ecosystem.

There are no downsides to the area becoming a Marine Sanctuary, but conversely by protecting this area, any future question of allowing oil drilling, or other action detrimental to the protected ocean will be prevented.

America should always treasure and protect all of its resources (anthropological, biological, historical, mineralogical, and others) in ADDITION to natural resources. Safeguarding the environment should not automatically preclude or prohibit human activity in any given area. The Just and Noble cause of stewarding the world given to us by God does not have to fall into a false dichotomy of either prohibiting human activity or letting man run rampant over the earth with no checks. I believe that the history of this area deserves recognition and safeguards but this proposed rule is harsh and anti-human flourishing.
      With regard to the outright ban on Fossil Fuel exploration, development, or production, the most reliable and clean form of energy is going to have deleterious effects on the environment of the rest of the world when more energy-intensive and harmful sources of energy that have wider footprints and greater environmental impact (including solar panels and wind) are substituted in the absence of Fossil Fuel and Nuclear Energy creation that will result from this rule. Safe extraction of Fossil Fuel resources could be regulated and enforced in such a manner as to protect all other resources without a harmful outright ban. 
       The prohibition on drilling into or altering submerged lands should be removed from this rule. It appears to not apply to multiple common-sense exemptions that undermine the argument for prohibiting this activity. Cultural heritage sites should be protected but the wording in this text is too broad. The points raised above also apply to this prohibition.

The proposed marine sanctuary will bridge the gap between the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary and the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary, permanently protecting these ecologically significant waters from habitat fragmentation, and thereby strengthening the area's health and resilience against of climate chaos, overfishing, and ocean fish farming. 

These waters include wildlife habitat, internationally significant undersea features, and submerged Chumash sites dating back more than 9,000 years.
Unique to this region, the proposed marine sanctuary encompasses the western slope of the underwater Santa Lucia Bank at the base of the continental shelf, a 3,000-meter-deep submarine canyon, three major nutrient upwellings, spawning areas and rookeries, and feeding areas and migration lanes for 13 species of whales and dolphins.

The Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary would protect one of the
largest remaining kelp forests, helping to combat climate breakdown while preserving sacred Chumash cultural sites.

It has been estimated that a national marine sanctuary off the Central Coast would generate at least $23 million in economic activity and create 600 new jobs.

Designating the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary would strengthen
marine research, education, and conservation along the coast while incorporating
the values and traditions of surrounding Indigenous communities.

We have a shared responsibility to create certain safeguards for our oceans and coastal resources. The proposed sanctuary would help meet our shared responsibility.

The YTT have a long-documented history of having ancestral ties to these lands and it is extremely harmful and disrespectful to not raise their voices up and prioritize their wishes and vast knowledge. Often times outsiders will talk about ""not wanting to get involved with Native politics"", but the government has been doing that for hundreds of years which is the reason why we are even in this situation.

I grew up in southern California and I am familiar with this incredibly beautiful and biologically diverse marine coastal area.  I applaud the tribal members and others who have been advocating for this sanctuary for many years. 

I urge NOAA to ensure that this management plan will contain sufficiently strong required protections that will prevent any future human uses from harming or jeopardizing the marine ecosystems and species within this sanctuary area.

The climate and extinction crises are already dangerous and rapidly getting worse.  These crises pose an existential threat to humanity and the health of the biosphere.  The status quo management of the past is no longer appropriate or sustainable.  Bold and innovative solutions are urgently needed.  I believe that creating and effectively protecting this sanctuary area will be a significant positive step forward.

Thank you very much for your kind consideration of my comments.

I am writing to support the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary designation. I am an Australian citizen, who has visited the central coast of California a couple of times over the last two years while visiting my husband's family.

 

What I’ve learned of the area is fascinating. The upswelling which occurs and attracts such an abundance of marine life creates an amazing, unique, and beautiful coast line to visit. I have loved my time driving down the coast and stopping to try spotting otters, dolphins, seals, and potentially whales.

 

As a foreign tourist, I believe protecting this area adds immense value. Protected sanctuaries become places of interest, bringing in more tourists to participate in the local economy. We stayed overnight in Morro Bay and San Luis Obispo, spending money on accommodation, food, and entertainment. That local spending wouldn’t have occurred if not for the stunning coastline which attracted us in the first place. I have told many people about our visit, with several others visiting this year based on stories of our visit. 



I believe Morro Bay should also be protected by the sanctuary. 



Regards,

 

Lee Byars

Thank you for all your work toward protecting another important part of California's coastal waters. I strongly support the Initial Boundary Alternative, 7,600 sq mi that links to the Monterey Bay NMS and the deep sea, rather than the NOAA preferred Alternative 2 Cropped Bank to Coast, 1,500 sq mi smaller that doesn't link north to the MBNMS or east to the deep sea. The bigger the conservation area the better in my opinion. We need to dramatically increase areas of protected waters and land to minimize the extent of the 6th mass extinction of biodiversity human activities are causing. Time is not on our side, biodiversity and ecosystems are collapsing, for only the 6th time in the Earth's 5-billion-year history. Our actions need to match the scale of the challenge. 

I recommend dealing with undersea cables and site naming concerns while protecting the full 7,600 acres. There are ways to accommodate cables and naming. On land utility easements exist through protected areas that allow that use to remain, maintained and modified in ways consistent with overall protections. I support adhering to site naming preferences by Indigenous communities and applaud the collaboration you've established with them on this and other projects.

Thank you for your consideration,

The new Sanctuary should include LARGE Marine Reserves where fishing is not allowed. Fishing is destructive and disruptive to the fragile ecosystem.  Marine mammal entanglements are nearly always a result of fishing gear.  Depletion of fish stocks such as baitfish, squid, groundfish, and rockfish has a negative impact on all species that rely on them for survival.  Humans have many other economical alternatives for a healthy diet - particularly a climate-friendly, plant-based diet.  Keeping the areas pristine for marine life will enhance eco-tourism in the region.  There are countless studies that provide examples from all over the nation that demonstrate that large marine protected areas where fishing is not allowed or carefully regulated are more resilient to the effects of climate change and provide enhanced economic opportunity for people who live in or near them. There is no reason to doubt that this will not be the case in the proposed Sanctuary.  Creating the new Sanctuary is a win-win for everyone, but in particular for the marine life that is part of the complex ecosystem.

In addition, the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary will allow focused community and scientific monitoring of this area as a benchmark to adjacent areas, such as the the proposed wind developments. Tribal co-management should be a cornerstone to protect the cultural, biological and other natural endowment of this precious part of our Central Coast.

The Chumash Heritage NMS sets a historical precedence in potentially being the first of our NMS co-managed by the Indigenous people whose lands we occupy. This will give them a say in the sanctuary's management to continue their stewardship of these lands and waters, protect important heritage sites they have occupied for upwards of 20,000 years, and advance their sovereignty. Indigenous communities have been the greatest advocates of environmental conservation for decades and it has been proven that they are crucial to protecting the biodiversity of our planet. They are experienced ecological caretakers as their cultures are built around balancing their relationship with the land and waters. I think this NMS will be crucial to preserving our coastal habitats, which are suffering from the effects of climate change, loss of biodiversity, human encroachment and development, and pollution.

It would also give indigenous leaders more power over a larger swath of the coastline and off-shore areas, which are lands and waters that still belong to them and which must be managed with the help of their generations of expertise and wisdom.

I’ve had the opportunity to study local California history as a new transplant (after I moved here over 10 years ago) and realized just how much the Chumash and Salinan tribes are the best stewards for both natural resources and ongoing economic health. Over and over we see patterns of businesses that are so focused on profits that they ignore the long-term implications of their practices, and over the decades we see how they crumble because it throws the ecosystem out of balance. Both businesses and environment suffer when short-term gains are the primary focus. However, the native communities excel at recognizing patterns, exercising patience, and knowing when to utilize natural resources and when to scale back. The methods they developed of stopping skin cancer, managing land and growth through careful planning and maintenance, using renewable materials without pollution, and knowing how to build an abundant food supply that never runs out are critical skills we need to learn from. I respect their wisdom and centuries of committed experience and I can’t think of a better investment to both our marine life and our communities (socially, economically, for respectful and incredible nature tourism, and culturally). The central coast is an incredibly special place and we need to keep it that way. This place is now permanently home for me and I want to see it flourish. Having a solid foundation and mindful, caring leadership is essential.

Approval of this proposed rule would not only safeguard this delicate and important ecosystem but would be a single step among many others to rectifying the harm done to the local Indigenous population. Additionally, this proposed rule would bolster the local economy and generate millions of dollars. With the closure of Diablo Canyon fast approaching, approval of this rule would generate much needed revenue to our municipal governments. I urge approval of this rule.

Secondly, I wish to express my support for the swift designation of the sanctuary. 

The waters off San Luis Obispo and northern Santa Barbara Counties contain Rodriguez Seamount, Arguello Canyon, Arguello Terrace, and Santa Lucia Bank. This region hosts a complex system of ocean currents, where warmer waters from the south meet colder waters from the north. The upwelling of colder, nutrient-rich deep waters towards the warmer surface nourishes marine life which migrates through five existing west coast national marine sanctuaries. For thousands of years, First Peoples got to know these waters, and the life they contain, well.

Designation of the CHNMS should be done with the Initial Boundary Alternative that was proposed at nomination, plus NOAA's excellent add-on alternative known as the Gaviota Coast Extension (Sub-Alt 5b).  The Environmental Impact Statement acknowledges that all other alternatives would reduce the beneficial effects on biological resources provided by the Initial Boundary Alternative to “moderate” or “minor” by comparison and increase the vulnerability of those resources to adverse impacts that the Initial Boundary Alternative would prohibit or mitigate. 

The Initial Boundary Alternative would protect the area that would be excluded by the agency preferred alternative from harmful activities such as offshore oil, while electric transmission cables from the offshore wind area can be permitted by the sanctuary. Such cables will already need approval from the State Lands Commission and other agencies, and can receive the type of permits offered in national marine sanctuaries for other cables that are used, for example, by communications companies. I understand that there is a marked difference between electric transmission and communications cables, nonetheless sanctuary protection in this area is important enough to warrant the extra effort needed to take care that such cables do not harm wildlife and habitats in the region. The area between Cambria and Hazard Canton Reef is environmentally and culturally significant, and deserves CHNMS protection.

I also support the name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary” to honor the cultural history and stewardship of California Tribal peoples. I also support the equitable inclusion of all Central Coast Tribes, both federally and non-federally recognized Tribes, in collaborative management. All sanctuary stakeholders will benefit from Indigenous input.

Sanctuary education and community outreach can partner with schools for programs on ocean ecology, and Tribal history and culture, which is multilingual, multi-cultural, and focused on underserved communities. Research programs can address the impacts of climate change and encourage community science and elevate the use of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) to enhance ecosystem-based management; teaching the benefits of protecting our ocean and planet and promoting the spirit of stewardship exemplified by the culture and history of the original Chumash caretakers.

I support regulations to protect Rodriguez Seamount, a critical habitat for an array of marine life. Sanctuary designation is needed before offshore wind operations to its northwest are established to protect the region from its impacts. California offshore wind operation’s leasing, siting, and permitting decisions should be guided by planning and research on its potential, cumulative impacts.

I recommend the creation of a Tribal Sanctuary Council made up of all interested local Tribal Groups. The designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary will be an unprecedented accomplishment honoring the history and culture of Native Americans, the Chumash people and their ancestors who inhabited this region for more than 10,000 years.

Climate change is the number one threat to humanity world wide. It’s time to take these issues very seriously. However, it’s important to remember the laborers that are impacted by green initiatives. Local fisherman and the oil workers that are impacted. The local fisheries should be paid off for not being able to fish the area. This will take care of people’s immediate needs while healing an overfish segment of the beautiful central california coast. Additionally, job trainings, opportunities and subsidies for WORKERS not corporations. These corporations have sucked all life out of the earth for decades of a barely regulated market. They deserve to be sent down the river and CEOs jailed for their crimes against humanity. HOWEVER, the workers are simply men and women working to put food on their tables and provide for themselves and their families. Labor and the average citizen needs to be considered when making these moves of the green movement will continue to be looked at as a “liberal elitist” movement. This is a movement for and by the people. The Democrat congressmen and politicians that like to make us fear republicans while doing much of the same dirty money hungry tactics need to remember that they will not continue to win if the people cannot survive. So, do the right thing and protect the planet but transition workers into good paying union jobs! Provide subsidies for fisheries for local fishermen that rely on this work. Labor consciousness and climate consciousness go hand in hand. Enough with corporate backers, you can’t swap corporate industries for a different set of corporate entities and have the people truly believe that you are on their side. Stop the capitalist hypocrisy. People are struggling to put food on their tables, pay rent and so on. Think workers first not corporations. Train, subsidize and relocate WORKER DIRECTLY, no money through NGOs, non profits or corporate benefactors.

Marine sanctuaries are an important method for protecting ocean biodiversity, which is under assault from commercial fishing as well as the increasing impacts of ocean warming and climate change. Although establishing a marine sanctuary will not stop the latter, we can do everything in our power to protect special marine areas from overfishing and use, to preserve the habitats and creatures upon which our ecosystem depends.

From a cultural perspective, it’s an important acknowledgment of the Chumash peoples and their relationship to this region to both designate a marine protected area and to name it in recognition of that relationship.

The nationally-significant natural resources, physical features and habitats, and the cultural and historical resources within the proposed sanctuary warrant long-term protection and management to reduce threats that would adversely affect their historical, cultural, archaeological, recreational, and educational value. Many threatened or endangered species, such as blue whales, snowy plovers, black abalone, white sharks, and leatherback sea turtles, rely on habitats, physical features, or prey found in the proposed sanctuary rely on habitats, physical features, or prey found in the proposed sanctuary. This area also contains hundreds of known or suspected shipwrecks of historical importance, including several on the National Register of Historic Places. Moreover, this region and its abundant resources have been home to coastal, ocean-going Indigenous tribes for tens of thousands of years, and submerged village sites may exist along paleoshorelines in the submerged lands of the proposed sanctuary. Several key threats to these natural, cultural, and historical resources include: various levels of human development and activity from: offshore energy development; decommissioning and removal of coastal and offshore industrial facilities; sound, discharges and whale strikes from vessel traffic; plastics, marine debris and pollutants from coastal runoff; and most of all, acute and cumulative impacts of climate change.
The fact this this new designation would prohibit future offshore drilling is an added bonus, and one in concert with the Biden Administration's efforts to transition the US economy to green energy. Since the disastrous 1968 oil spill the Santa Barbara region has fought to protect the environment from drilling in order to protect delicate marine ecosystems. This new sanctuary designation is welcomed by environmentalists and Chumash natives, and all who want to protect this area from destructive and irresponsible petrolium development. This is a significant site that deserves Federal protection.

I am writing to express my concern with the process for ensuring local recreational fishermen and spear fishermen are given due consideration. As a San Luis Obispo local who has lived in the area for 32 years I regularly surf, fish, and freedive in the purposed sanctuary. Currently I don't see any purposed impact to local fishing regulations but it does seem that they can be changed. Whatever method of review is put in place will need to involve the community and have the best interest of the local population. Much of the work for protecting the local fisheries has been very successful but it needs to be continuedly mentioned that the local interests be considered. 

Another point to mention is aquaculture. It is mentioned in a positive note in the documentation. From my personal experience in Mexico and Norway aquaculture is extremely detrimental to the local environment. I do not support development locally.

Native Americans cannot manage an Ocean, nor should they despite past rights.

Nor should any group; circumstances notwithstanding.

Let the Chumash manage their new found wealth other defeated nations never receive.
But don’t give them access or authorization over a body of water that belongs to all people, not just Native Americans who already take 36% of all west coast salmon, more than the seals. Let NOAA manage and do not give the Chumash the right to take fish, mammals or anything from the sea, nor commercial and sport fishing vessels and I own one vessel.
I’ve witnessed the sorrowful depletion of what was once an aduntant bountiful sea which needs protection! But not from all but a few who could destroy what is left, have no training in today’s restoration techniques. Two entities overseeing one body of water presents conflicts by definition so to avoid even the appearance of impropriety, please pass the Act creating a larger zone of no kill ocean applicable to all.
You are ceding rights we the US won or took 150 years ago, irrespective of the origins of our rights, they exist today for all people to enjoy the sea, Chumash included.

Turbine kill birds and whales not to mention other animals. Wind Turbines are not normal and Morro Bay has no need for the turbines since there will no longer be need for electricity into lithium battery storage. Lithium (batteries) cause fire when combined with water. https://firefighterline.com/how-to-put-out-lithium-battery-fire/  

Also Turbines are made by China and parts come from China. Turbines leak oil and cause more pollution than a car. https://dailycaller.com/2017/03/03/dirty-secret-behind-wind-turbines-they-need-lots-of-oil/

Replacing parts coming from China should be ruled out all together. China will withhold parts to get what they want causing energy blackouts. 

I cannot think of one good thing why Turbines should be used at all in any way. Wind Turbines have no use in a bird sanctuary except to kill birds. 

Please do your homework and do not allow Cayucos or Morro Bay to build these death turbines. There are other forms of energy. The Chumash Heritage National Marine Santuary should include Morro Bay and Cayucos.

My name is Patrick Bosold. I now live in Iowa. I'm a former resident of California, which I still consider my second home. I worked on the campaign to establish the California Coastal Conservation Commission in 1972. Over the years, it's become increasingly apparent that we need to protect the marine areas off of the California coast in order to ensure that the coastal experience will continue to be a good one. 
I'm SO pleased to hear that NOAA is finally considering a National Marine Sanctuary for the Chumash nation. I urge you to get this done quickly. California's near-coast waters have been under siege for decades. This needs to be stopped and reversed by establishing the proposed Chumash Nation National Marine Sanctuary and ensuring that the Chumash nation, which stewarded these waters for a thousand years and more, is given a leading voice in the establishment and management of the Sanctuary.
I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover approximately 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.
Every time I've gone swimming, snorkeling, sailing or whale watching along the California coast, it's reawakened me to what a priceless natural resource this area is. I'll be doing this again in early November and it would be incredibly heartening to know that this part of the California coast has won the protections that a National Marine Sanctuary provides.
Therefore, I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes: 
Biggest Possible Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension - DON'T shrink it, please!!!
Sanctuary Name: The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”
Tribal Collaborative Management: An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management.
Outreach & Education: Outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities
Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity
Ban Oil & Gas: A prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries. This may sound like a no-brainer, but it must be said.
No offshore wind: there's been talk of carving out and removing a section of the proposed Sanctuary for an offshore wind project. I've worked in the renewable energy industry and I'm a passionate advocate for wind and solar. In this case, what I'd suggest is, no wind turbines in the Sanctuary area. If somebody wants to develop renewables in this area, bring it onshore. Work with the Chumash and other coastal tribes on smaller-scale, distributed solar projects. 
Once again, I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary quickly. Let's allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

I am writing in support of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension.

I live in Morro Bay, California.  The Pacific Ocean is essential to the economy and well-being of our community and surrounding areas.  It supports tourism, commercial fishing, recreation and solace for residents and visitors.  It is vital to keep it healthy and safe so the community can continue to enjoy and benefit from it.  

The Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary should include:
•	The largest possible boundary to maintain habitat and biodiversity.
•	A ban on all oil and gas development within its boundaries.  
•	Consideration for our small local commercial fishing community and other local underserved communities.
•	Outreach, education and research programs to increase knowledge and awareness of the ocean’s importance.
•	Protection for the Rodriguez Seamount to protect biodiversity.

Thank you!

The spirits jump out over the ocean there to go to the land of the dead, retracing the route of their original ancestral settlement voyages from early Polynesia.. As such, it is a very sacred and historic place. It thus represents the site of one of the earliest settlements on the California coast, as the Chumash settled there very early in California history. The paragraph below is a passage from my forthcoming book, ""Stars on Earth: TransPacific Navigation and Settlement of the Americas,"" (2023) regarding the ""Chumash Jumping-Off Place"":
 
	The Chumash Western Gate has been interpreted as being a pathway to the afterlife for souls going to the next world. The gate was considered to be ethereal: “Traditional Chumash did not believe that there was literally a gate at Point Humqaq. It was instead known as a place of ascension, which in some literature is called a Jumping­-off Place,” a Portal for the Spirits of Chumash Dead to fly westward to the Land of Similaqsa (Anderson 2020b, 24).
	There is a Land in the west for Chumash spirits to aim toward:
""An old woman living among the Samala Chumash in the 1910s, M. S. Qiliqutayiwit, explained to John Harrington from the Smithsonian Institution the traditional funerary teachings that were handed down to her by her elders. She told Harrington that after death: 'The soul goes first to Point Conception, which is a wild and stormy place. It was called Humqaq, and there was no village there. In ancient times no one ever went near Humqaq. They only went near there to make sacrifices at a great Sawil. There is a place at Humqaq below the cliff that can only be reached by rope, and there is a pool of water there like a basin into which fresh water continually drips. And there in the stone can be seen the footprints of women and children. There the spirit of the dead bathes itself. Then it sees a light to the westward and goes toward it through the air, and thus reaches the land of Similaqsa.'” (Anderson 2020b, 23, quoting Blackburn 1975, 98)

The designation of the CHNMS should include the largest possible contiguous boundaries, the Initial Boundary Alternative with the Gaviota Coast Extension (Sub-Alt 5b), because it would provide the most protection to this important area. We do not support NOAA’s Alternatives 2, 3, and 4 because they would not protect a critical area of coastline that contains important Chumash cultural sites, marine habitat, and local communities.

First, please support the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary name. It is meant to recognize people that have lived on this coast for over 10,000 years; protect the heritage of the Chumash, an ocean-going band among the First People of the Pacific Coast; and provide a timely and appropriate reminder of the cultural origins. We support equitable inclusion of all Central Coast Tribes, both federally and non-federally recognized Tribes, in collaborative management. All sanctuary stakeholders will benefit from Indigenous input. 

It is vital that Sanctuary education and community outreach should partner with area schools to share information about sanctuary species and habitats and Chumash history and culture. Outreach should be multilingual, culturally relevant, and should focus on underserved communities.

In addition, regulations to protect Rodriguez Seamount should move forward. The seamount provides critical habitat for an extremely diverse and abundant array of marine life and deserves to be granted strong and permanent protection. The seamount has special national significance that warrants special protections through sanctuary designation. Once damaged, fragile seamount ecosystems may not recover in our lifetime.

The proposed CHNMS will protect our beloved ocean now that Offshore Wind (OSW) farms are being established off the Central California Coast. Sanctuary designation is needed before OSW and other environmental impacts affect the habitat, wildlife, and water quality. California’s first offshore wind projects must reflect leasing, siting, and permitting decisions that are guided by planning and comprehensive scientific research on the potential impacts to sensitive marine areas and species and coastal resources, including cumulative impacts.

I strongly support the Gaviota coast extension as this is one of the last stretches of undeveloped coastline in California with a rich marine ecosystem.

I support offshore wind as the biggest threat to the Sanctuary is accelerated climate change and ocean acidification, and the only answer to that is rapid energy decarbonization and a variety of renewable energy sources. It would be preferable to not to leave out the Morro Bay area to allow for cabling, but rather have an expedited permit or carve out exception for all needed cables and offshore wind infrastructure so that you can still extend other Sanctuary protections to the area, while allowing offshore wind to co-exist with the Sanctuary. However, the agency-preferred boundaries would be preferable to a larger Sanctuary if the larger Sanctuary prevents or delays offshore wind development. Many environmentalists I know who are avid Sanctuary proponents would choose wind energy over a larger Sanctuary, but would prefer the larger Sanctuary AND wind energy.  

Shipping poses a significant threat to whales, including endangered blue whales. I support a speed limit in Sanctuary waters to prevent whale strikes. The Sanctuary should prioritize carbon sequestration. Every whale sequesters as much carbon as thousands of trees according to the International Monetary Fund, December 2019 ""A strategy to protect whales can limit greenhouse gases and global warming""

I support marine protected areas, including areas that prohibit fishing. These areas have been proven to provide greater biomass and diversity of marine life and spill over into other areas. They improve fisheries. See, for example, June 2023 Smithsonian, ""Marine Protected Areas Improve Health, Wealth of Nearby Communities"" and World Economic Forum, Nov 2020, ""Expanding marine protected areas could boost fish yields"". They cite a study that found by expanding the world’s MPAs by just 5%, we could boost future fish catches by at least 20%

One of the biggest threats to the Sanctuary region is oil spills, particularly from Exxon's oil platforms (Heritage, Harmony, and Hondo). A May 2015 oil spill by Refugio beach that flowed into the ocean through a culvert caused huge marine damage, and an offshore spill would be far worse. The platforms have been shut down since the spill, now over 8 years ago, but Exxon would like to restart them. This has been opposed by Santa Barbara County, which denied their oil trucking plan as well as work on the corroded pipeline that caused the spill that might lead to restart. (Plains, the owner of the pipeline was prosecuted by the County and State of California and found criminally negligent in failing to maintain the pipeline.) Exxon is working on a proposal for a new pipeline over a number of rivers and streams through Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo and Kern County to facilitate restart of these offshore platforms. However, the platforms and pipes to shore where designed to last 25 years and they are now over 40 years old. A new pipeline would propose to extend their life another 40 years, which would present a terrible on-going threat to the Sanctuary. While these platforms are indicated as ""Outside proposed sanctuary boundaries for all alternatives""  DEIS Table 4.7-1, p. 169. P. 167 describes the oil and gas infrastructure within the boundaries, including the oil pipeline within the boundaries of sub-alt 5b.  Therefore, the Sanctuary should evaluate the safety of restarting this shut down pipeline within it's boundaries. It is with excellent reason that Sanctuaries prohibit new oil development, but the exception for existing oil leases should not mean that infrastructure long shuttered after a bad oil spill should automatically be allowed to restart without proof that it can do so safely and without risk to the Sanctuary. Exxon's oil processing facility on the coast was also the largest facility source of greenhouse gas emissions in Santa Barbara County, and allowing restart would increase emissions in the Sanctuary, which runs counter to the whole exercise of trying to protect this marine area.

The special qualities embodied by this area’s pristine ocean, beaches, near shore and coastal mountains have anchored our love for and identification with California’s central coast, and San Luis Obispo county in particular.  The thought that these qualities may be preserved for future generations with the establishment of the sanctuary brings joy to our hearts. 

The gradual deepening of our respect and appreciation for these coastal lands and waters has been fostered by the integrity and dedication of certain locals of Chumash ancestry, for whom the concept of the unbuilt world as sanctuary is self-evident and visceral.  These and other dedicated individuals have tirelessly built public support for permanent protections of our coast for well over the four decades that we have resided here.  It is a honor today to stand with them in support of the sanctuary.

The sanctuary boundaries we support are the Initial Boundary Alternative and the Gaviota Coast Extension, specifically including the area from Montana de Oro to Cambria and eliminating any carveout for access to the proposed future Morro Bay wind energy lease area.

Creating one continuous sanctuary from the Gaviota coast to the waters off Cambria, coterminous with the Monterey Bay Marine Sanctuary, is the original intention of the sanctuary effort, and this must be respected.

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the proposed boundaries. Your efforts towards the establishment of the Chumash Heritage Marine Sanctuary are deeply appreciated.

-

The City of San Luis Obispo strongly supports the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary (CHNMS) and urges the NOAA to approve the proposed rulemaking that would designate over 5,500 square miles of waters along and offshore of the coast of central California as the CHNMS. 

The coast is vital to California. The CHNMS will help sustain biodiversity, provide recreational opportunity for the people of the state and the nation, and help sustain the economy based on tourism. As the CHNMS will fill the gap between two existing sanctuaries, it will magnify the positive effect of those existing sanctuaries and protect an area that is central to California's history and ecology. 

The Chumash and Salinan peoples have fished and gathered in the waters off the Central Coast of California for over 10,000 years. The cultural, ecological, and historical resources of this region are of national significance, and the area warrants long-term protection and management. 

The City of San Luis Obispo is particularly supportive of NOAA’s proposal to develop a coordinated, community-based management regime in partnership with Indigenous tribes and tribal organizations, and to implement a collaborative management structure to involve Indigenous communities in important management programs and initiatives. NOAA should fully honor and affirm the sovereignty of the first stewards of these waters through its Framework for Indigenous Collaborative Management. 

The City of San Luis Obispo is happy to join with the vast number of supporters in advocating for the approval the proposed Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary.

I ask that this sanctuary includes: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension, including the protection of Rodriguez Seamount, so that the entire ecosystem is protected; that it be designated “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary” to honor the original stewards of the ecosystem; An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management to reinstate their effective stewardship methods; Outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities; and, most importantly, a prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries to safeguard this unique ecosystem for future generations.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

I am writing to express my support for the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative, along with the Gaviota Coast Extension. This designation aims to cover approximately 7,600 square miles of ocean in order to protect biodiversity and habitats. 

As a resident of Ojai, California, I consider the ocean to be a valuable and fragile ecosystem that is in great need of protection. Whenever I visit the coast, I take the time to explore the beach, appreciate wildlife, and reflect on the history of my ancestors who resided in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties for many generations. The ocean holds personal significance for me, as it is not only a source of recreation and spiritual well-being, but also an important aspect of community connections and economic vitality. It is essential to ensure that future generations are able to enjoy a clean, safe, and healthy ocean and continue to benefit from it.

The ocean's beauty and mystery have taught us a great deal, yet there is still much more to learn. Establishing a sanctuary would provide crucial support for ongoing research and education, serving present and future generations. Therefore, I fully endorse the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I kindly request that this sanctuary be established with the following considerations:

- The Initial Boundary Alternative, along with the Gaviota Coast Extension, to ensure the largest possible protection area.
- The name ""Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary"" to honor the heritage of the area.
- A collaborative management approach that includes all tribes for equitable decision-making.
- Outreach, education, and research programs that acknowledge and promote Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and facilitate access for underserved local communities.
- The protection of Rodriguez Seamount, as it plays a vital role in preserving biodiversity.
- A prohibition on new oil and gas development within sanctuary boundaries.

In conclusion, I wholeheartedly support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to take swift action in order to allow both current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from the many treasures that our ocean holds.

My name is Gillian Heald and I support the expedited designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover approximately 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I live in Santa Barbara, California and when I heard about this proposal, I was filled with relief and gratitude, that NOAA would be considering a proposal that could change the future of the planet and all of it's inhabitants, by starting with one 7600 square mile area--by designating it as an oceanic refuge--a sanctuary. This Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary could be a leading edge, an idea worth spreading out to more and more locations, generating more sanctuaries up and down the west coast of the United States. 

I swim regularly in the Pacific Ocean at Santa Barbara's clean beaches. I am a surfer and ride the waves. I body surf too. I walk on the shores with my husband and with my friends. I ride my bike along the path. My husband races in a Harbor 20 with his crew every Wednesday and most weekends out of the Santa Barbara Harbor. This Ocean is more than a recreation spot or even a beautiful location of the highest order of the Natural Kingdom. To me, It is a Living Spiritual Being and I am devoted to It as I am devoted to God. My devotion is to protect our beloved, sacred ocean as we would protect a baby, with fierce courage and gentle care. If we protect it now as a sanctuary, then it will serve future generations with all of it's bounty. If we do not act now, we will see further degradation of our ecosystem including pollution and harm to the biodiversity already under duress.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. and I want it to include: 
1. The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension
2. The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”
3. An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management.
4. Outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities
5. The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity
6. Complete prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries

This is an urgent matter that requires designation.

   My name is Julie Mascarenhas, a coastal California resident.  Please rush to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and our precious marine habitats.
   I live on the Monterey Bay, and as a student was involved in the original designation of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary back in the 1990s, which has been essential for our local coastal protections.  My kids have grown up on the water; my family and I frequent the coastal access areas and beaches, river outputs, estuarine systems, watch wildlife, and swim and paddleboard frequently.  They are connected to nature through our California ocean. We support the thriving local seafood economy, made safer by national marine sanctuary designation. 
   I am a marine ecologist working throughout the California Current ecosystem from Baja California, Mexico up to Vancouver Island.  The marine transition zone waters around Point Conception and up to Morro Bay are a critical area in need of protection in the CA Current system – plankton, krill, forage fish and top predators including large fish and sharks, seabirds, pinnipeds, dolphins and whales congregate in this zone.  We need protected areas as ecological climate refugia as climate change intensifies, particularly preventing damaging oil and gas extraction. 
   The Chumash marine waters are so important to their tribal culture and livelihood, which historically has largely been stripped from them.  They are marine stewards, largely prevented from carrying out their ongoing cultural task of protecting the marine waters where they live and striving for balance.  
   The ocean is also spiritually important for me personally – I have always lived on the ocean, and it is painful each time humans despoil the coast and ocean.  
Therefore, I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, including:
•	Biggest Possible Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension
•	Sanctuary Name: “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”
•	Tribal Collaborative Management: An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management and decisions from the outset, not after-the-fact
•	Outreach & Education: Outreach, education and research programs that highlight both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities, in multiple languages and multiple platforms to promote equal accessibility
•	Protection of Rodriguez Seamount: The inclusion of this important location to protect critical biodiversity and trophic transfer
•	Ban Oil & Gas: A prohibition on new oil and gas development within sanctuary boundaries
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, and urge the Administration to act swiftly on a comprehensive designation to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.
 Sincerely,
Julie Mascarenhas

	•I have been Sailing 
in this magical Pacific Ocean since I was five years old, for 55 years now. I love watching Mama and baby Humpback Whales feeding and playing with the dolphins in the ocean in Morro Bay and Cayucos. 
I want to absolutely make sure the Humpback Whales are protected when they migrate to and feed along the ocean coastline in Morro Bay, Cayucos and Cambria every summer and fall to feed before they migrate back to Mexico and South America. 
I want protection for the migrating Gray Whales along the coasts 
We also have the Morro Bay Harbor Porpoises that are unique only to Morro Bay and there are only a small number of them left. During the 
PGE seismic testing, marine biologist’s research has shown that the Morro Bay Porpoises were trying to escape the blasting and went into Bottle Nose Dolphins territories and some of them were killed. 
That was caused by man made seismic testing noise and normally would not have happened, 
as the Morro Bay Harbor Porpoises only stay in a small area. Because their numbers are small their biodiversity can be jeopardized and they may not be able to recover. 
When I go to the coast, 
I go with my family sailing, kayaking, wading in the surf, surfing, explore the beach and watch the wildlife.

My name is Linnea Schaefer and I want to express my unequivocal support for the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.
I grew up in San Luis Obispo county, and have pursued education and a career in biology since moving away from the central coast. California’s coastline is one of its most precious places and ecosystems. The Pacific ocean houses immense biodiversity and wonder and means so much to those of us who have had the chance to experience it. I go to the coast to watch birds and wildlife, swim in the water, walk along the dunes in Morro Bay, explore the tide pools at Montana de Oro, or canoe and kayak across Morro Bay. Some of my earliest memories are from days along the coast. It is so important to me that the ocean and coastline are protected from resource extraction to benefit the communities and wildlife who use it, including many endangered and threatened wildlife species to whom this represents critical habitat in the road to recovery.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that the sanctuary lines honor the original boundary proposed by the Chumash, and include the areas offshore of Morro Bay, Cayucos, and Cambria under its protection. Morro Bay provides critical habitat for migratory shorebirds and recovering populations of sea otters, San Simeon is home to the once nearly-extinct Northern elephant seals, and Cambria holds some of the coasts’s healthiest intertidal invertebrate communities. In addition, Morro Bay and the surrounding area hold great cultural significance for the Chumash who inhabited and stewarded the unceded land and ocean we now live on.  


I ask that this sanctuary includes: 
* Morro Bay, Cayucos, and Cambria areas 
* Biggest Possible Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension
* Sanctuary Name: The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”

I am an enrolled member of the Pechanga Band of Indians from Temecula, California, which is not too far from the proposed area. Our Native people are ocean people, as well as valley people. The ocean has always been a special place of connection for us, and vital for our traditional ways, and mental, physical, and spiritual well-being. I know that it is the same for the Chumash; This is a deeply spiritual place, where we conduct ceremony, utilize its natural resources for our traditional foods, regalia, and other utilitarian arts, and where we connect and maintain healthy relationships with human and non-human relatives. Being around a clean, healthy ocean, feels good, to put it simply. Being in close proximity to the ocean boosts our mental, emotional, and spiritual well-being.

I want to protect this stretch of ocean so my community and the Chumash communities can continue to connect with and benefit from a clean, safe, and healthy ocean.

We support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

We are a 501c3 based in the coastal city of Oxnard, CA. Through the work of volunteers, we grow native plants from seed and plant them throughout the city. We are grateful for the ocean. We are grateful for the marine layer it produces that creates our precious year-round temperate climate (something that we might lose due to climate change) which in turn creates our unique coastal sage scrub, dune, lagoons, and alkali meadow habitats.

My name is Susan Garman and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and the Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about  7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I live in Cambria, California; to me the ocean is our wilderness and holds our hope to protect an ecosystem, indigenous coastal history and native wildlife from destruction.

I spend considerable time along the coast on a daily basis, enjoying the natural beauty, recreating, removing litter and rescuing wildlife in distress. I actively volunteer with numerous local nonprofits and do all I can to protect our coast and help mitigate any damage inflicted by human interactions.

Failing to retain the Initial Boundary Alternative by excluding Cambria, Cayucos, Morro Bay and part of Montano de Oro from this sanctuary is a mistake. It places this richly biodiverse area in a very vulnerable position, surrounded by protected areas and yet not itself protected. Failing to afford these unique coastal areas the same protections as the rest of the Central Coast leaves them more vulnerable to exploitation which will surely threaten sea life in the area and subject this area of the coast to an increased risk of future spoilage.
 

Thank you for protecting the coast for everyone!

My name is Barbara Leighton.  As a Unitarian Universalist person of faith and a grandmother, I wholeheartedly support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, as quickly as possible.  I urge adoption of the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.
In my life, I have appreciated the beautiful wonders, resilience and life sustaining nature of protected spaces.  I have also witnessed the degradation, pollution, and impoverishment of sacrifice zones and unfettered development.  Destruction is easy.  Repair is difficult and sometimes impossible.  Maintenance takes commitment and care for the long term.
I believe we need to do all we can to protect healthy environments that sustain many future generations of life including all precious grandchildren.
The Chumash preserved this area since ancient times and deserve to be part of the sanctuary name as well as participate in collaborative management.  We need to codify preservation of this area, including protection of the Rodriguez Seamount.  We need to ban oil & gas development in this area.  We can do this by committing to the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary and educating future generations to care for and preserve ocean life for posterity.

I'm writing in support of the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I work in Goleta and live part-time in Santa Barbara and I've come to appreciate what a huge presence the ocean has and always has had on the region. Currently, it draws in the tourists that make Santa Barbara more vibrant than other small seaside town; UCSB students love the campus location close to the sea. But from visiting local museums and learning about the Chumash Sanctuary initiative, I've also come to appreciate that the ocean's meaning is much deeper for the tribes who have lived on the coast for centuries.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I know there are many requests being made by different individuals. For me, especially the below seem like important priorities: 

The sanctuary should be named “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary” to honor the traditional custodians of the area
All local tribes - and I hope non-federally-recognized tribes as well - should be involved in managing the sanctuary collaboratively
Outreach programs in the sanctuary should include education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities
As a sign of California's commitment to a sustainable future, new oil and gas development in the sanctuary should be banned

I grew up in Sacramento, California but my parents would regularly take me and my sister to the Central Coast and stay with my grandparents in Pismo Beach. Some of my fondest childhood memories are exploring this region of the coast, from rocky tidepools to sandy beaches. This stretch of ocean has been so special to me and my family, and I want to see the federal protection of it to ensure that my children and grandkids will have the same opportunities as me.  Of course the rich history of the Chumash tribe in the area also provides a great opportunity for preservation of the native heritage and cultural values of the people that have lived here for thousands of years. Additionally, some of California’s most unique biological heritage thrives here, as the annual grey whale migration passes through this region, and our largest and most endangered bird, the California condor, has been making a comeback along these coastlines.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. In the interest of facilitating California’s transition to green energy, I would like to see the boundary cropped to allow for the planned undersea cables of the Morro Bay Wind Energy Area. However I ask that this sanctuary includes protection of the biologically significant Rodriguez Seamount and that the boundary stretches eastward to the Gaviota Coast. I want to see a strict prohibition on new oil and gas development within sanctuary boundaries. I strongly advocate for an equitable approach to include all Tribes in collaborative management, and that the name of the sanctuary reference the Chumash heritage: “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”. I would like to see this management strongly focus on outreach, education, and research, implementing both a scientific approach and a Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) approach. 

Thank you for considering my comments.

The California Current ecosystem is a very special ecological place. As a biologist who specializes in seabirds, I am personally strongly interested in increased protections for this area from that perspective. I am especially supportive of this designation in order to protect this area from exploration, development, or production of oil, gas, or mineral resources.

I STRONGLY URGE that NOAA Our all-important ocean upwelling and the Pacific Current Ecosystem will not be protected by the artificial and inadequate boundaries recently dictated by the offshore wind industry. Just tell NOAA “close the gap” and adopt the Initial Boundary Option for the proposed Chumash Marine Sanctuary.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. It is vital that we do all we can to protect the marine ecosystem to the largest extent possible.  
My name is Melissa Lovett-Adair and I am a resident of the county and city of San Luis Obispo. We still have much to learn about the ocean, and as our climate rapidly changes, we can waste no time in protecting it. We must protect the largest possible area, including the originally proposed boundary and the Gaviota coast extension. 
Having participated in one of the excellent informational presentations, I understand the proposed exclusion of Morro Bay is due to two main concerns. First is the issue of the undersea cables needed for off shore wind energy.  I support wind energy and do not believe these uses are incompatible. I understand that permits can be issued which will allow the undersea cables to be built.  The sanctuary designation and permitting process will provide assurance that the work is done with the highest level of protection for the marine ecosystem.  This is appropriate and acceptable.  We can move forward with renewable energy while caring for the environment. 
The second concern I heard is that the Salinan people object to the Chumash name. I respect the concerns of the Salinan people, but this should not be allowed to create gaps in the protection of the ocean.  The Chumash people have put decades of work into this proposal and have offered ways to resolve their concern including changing the name.  The important thing is to get the protection in place with the largest possible boundary.  Indigenous traditional lands overlap in many areas. Internal conflicts arise within and between groups. The process for shared management with Indigenous people includes opportunities for involvement and council from multiple tribal groups. This shared management structure is a vital new understanding of our shared responsibility and commitment to undoing past wrongs. The sanctuary protection must be continuous from the Monterey Bay Sanctuary to the Channel Islands Sanctuary. 
Thank you for the opportunity to express my support of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary.  
Melissa Lovett-Adair

The proposed boundary change to the CHNMS is outrageous and tantamount to a gerrymandering of the California coastline. It is clear that NOAA has disregarded the National Significance Criteria, as well as the Management Considerations, that were satisfied during the Nomination process and served as the foundation of the Initial Boundary. This ill conceived carve out of our precious coastline is a betrayal to those of us who have supported the establishment of this sanctuary for many years.

Just today, I witnessed an amazing display of humpback whale activity in Estero Bay right offshore from Morro Bay. Estero Bay, which has been eliminated from the current proposed map, has an abundance of marine life and bird life year round. This area serves a vital access point to visitors from all over the world who observe, learn, and engage in this unique marine environment. It is one of the very few places on the California coast where the endangered Southern Sea Otter can be closely observed right from the shoreline. Furthermore, this area is a regular destination for school field trips from throughout this region. Morro Rock with its amazing presence and relevance to indigenous peoples should be the heart of this sanctuary, not excised from it.

I implore you to designate the boundaries of the proposed National Marine Sanctuary as follows: The Initial Boundary Alternative with the Gaviota Coast Extension ( Sub-Alt 5b); additionally, the waters offshore of Point Buchon, Morro Bay, Cayucos, and Cambria should be included. This is essential to create the largest possible contiguous sanctuary boundaries for protection of the California coastline.

That sensitive and biodiverse habitat MUST Include Morro Bay, and must not sacrifice that sensitive habitat for Wind Farms under the guise of GREEN Energy!! There is NOTHING green in that proposed wind farm on the ocean but the DOLLARS it represents for businesses that will build and run it. NO to sacrificing Morrro Bay for the ABUSE by our state's needs for energy and the LIE that it is safe for the wildlife that FILLS this area and relies on that nearly pristine habitat for survival. 

I live in Encinitas on the coast of Southern California, but my son is in San Luis Obispo, my extended family is in Morro Bay, and I spend time at many beaches and lagoons along our coast. I value this coastline, the ocean, and the fact that we all rely on these waters for survival! There is NO OTHER more important or less disturbed habitat on earth!  This is one of the most biodiverse, well -preserved, and beautiful coasts in the state and we cannot allow it to be exploited or invaded and ultimately destroyed by US, for the performative and false narrative of GREEN ENERGY!! Stop the lie, and preserve ALL of this proposed sanctuary from any development. 
Sensitive species, Humpback Whales, Dolphins, countless fish species, otters, seals, and thousands of birds are at risk! 

The ocean is our life support system. As the daughter of a biology teacher, I understand our dependence on the ocean for food, climate stability, recreation,  spiritual well-being, economic health, and our own survival!
I want to protect this stretch of ocean so we all can continue to connect with and benefit from a clean, safe, and healthy ocean filled with diverse wildlife upon which WE DEPEND!
 A sanctuary will mean long-term protection, important ocean research opportunities, and environmental education for present and future generations!
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, but I want it to include the:
Biggest Possible Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension, and INCLUDE MORRO BAY.
Sanctuary Name: The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary” but with the addition of other tribal names in sections of the sanctuary if possible.
Tribal Collaborative Management: An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management, along with qualified dedicated marine scientists.
Outreach & Education: Outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities
Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity
Ban Oil & Gas: A prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries.
Prohibition of WIND FARMS or any development detrimental to wildlife within sanctuary boundaries.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow the strongest preservation for the delicate balance of sensitive habitats supporting fish stocks, wildlife within and above the sea, and the majestic beauty of this nearly pristine ecosystem.

My name is Charles Lawrence and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the largest possible boundaries to better protect 7,600 square miles of ocean area off of California’s Central Coast.

I live in Ventura, California and to me, the ocean has been a home and center of recreation for most of my time on the central coast.

As a resident of Ventura Harbor for over 15 years as a live aboard, sailor and fisherman, I have experienced all of the wonder, bounty and beaty of the area despite human and commercial encroachment. The area still provides enough marine health to support some of the few commercial fish and squid fleets left on the California coast. More encroachment on the natural environment is sure to impact all of these uses.
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes:

The largest possible boundary to maximize protection of ocean habitat and wildlife
A prohibition on oil and gas exploration or development
Water quality protections
Seafloor protections for the Rodriguez Seamount
Collaborative management that includes all interested local Native American Tribes
Education and community outreach that is multilingual, multicultural, and focused on local underserved communities.
Recreational use provisions to encourage future generations ability to experience including diving and fishing
“Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary” as the official name of the sanctuary.
I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

I live in Ojai and my work is in researching and creating artwork inspired by kelp. Our kelp forests are a superpower and need to be protected. With much of the kelp along the Northern California Coast disappearing, we must take action to protect these vulnerable forests. Kelp forests provide habitat for hundreds of species, filter the water, hold the shoreline from erosion and sequester more carbon than any forest on land. Globally, kelp forests are critical for the maintenance of biodiversity and mitigation of climate impacts, but are challenged.

Its not for the benefit of wildlife. It puts EPA right on top. Making it look like its supporting indian tribes.  By setting rules regulations and stealing land ocean from the American people. The citizens of these areas.  Govrnment setting standards rules for the lands waters to put wat they want and what they dont want. Its just a manipulation to benefit government. Not the indians.  These areas will be in a research study area. Itbwontbe preserved. Already there have been laws rules implemented to keep others businesses entities from destroying taking away the natural resources away from the Ametican people and its citizens.  So Indian tribes and government do not need to get involved in taking these oceans the land wildlife ocean life marine life and the biological underground reefs etc. All this land has been in the peoples hands for years and it has been protected already.  Government along with Indians are just trying to take away land and property from the American people the central coast citizens and visitors who enjoy and preserve what is there.  It already is in the county it should stay as is.  In its natural beauty ecological state for everyone to use. Stay out the central coast. No research no studying no preservation no wind turbines no underwater underground works.  The seals sharks dolphins all fishlife arebdoing fine. The fisherman boaters have not abused these areas and congress/ legislators etc have already banned oil exploration etc from these areas.  This is just a manipulation by government using the Indian tribe to manipulate there agenda there needs.  These areas have been already been preserved sustained kept healthy and vital for all of the wildlife , plant life etc for centuries.  There are already laws regulations etc put in place to keep this land oceans area safe pristine for generations.  It should be kept as it is.I request no changes no Chumash and no government be allowed to take these areas for there purposes. No matter what there intentions/ideas are. There has been no problems in all the years it has sat. And if there had been, they had been addressed by the county already.  To do what is planned by Chumash and government would be wrong.  Even with the good intentions of preserving this land as it i s  written. The land and oceans around it would change. Because of the ideas because of the plans they want ti make. As it stands now it is being preserved naturally already no new businesses/facilities organizations preservationists etc have moved want these areas and it is not being abused by anybody.  Having Chumash and government involved would change that. The ecological marine life plants etc everything around it would be manipulated , investigated, touched changed, more traffic more people because of studies because of the ideas they have in place and new ideas want to put in place. These areas already have been preserved without special groups/government and others trying to change that.  It is wrong to put limits rules regulations etc on these areas. So I ask you please for the good of the land do not change that. Do not turn it over to chumash Tribe and government ideas.  Thank u. Please keep me up to date on decision.  I beg u do not do this. For the best interests of the land already being used for the good of generations. I have lived in ths area for 60 years and my family and friends have taken care of these areas and will continue to . It will not be abused. And has not been abused. For already there are laws that have protected these areas already. And the people of theese areas continue to respect n not abuse the beautiful wildlife plants land ocean marine life etc.  They have spoken up for all abuses when it was neccessary and arisen.

I support the designation of the Initial Boundary Alternative with the Gaviota Coast Extension (Sub-Alt 5b). Including the waters offshore Point Buchon, Morro Bay, Cayucos, and Cambria will close the California Central Coast’s biodiversity protection gap between Monterey Bay and Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuaries. This will protect the only eelgrass bed in a 300-mile stretch of coast; many historic Chumash sites, including Lisamu’ (Morro Rock); numerous protected marine mammals and shorebirds; the highest population of Southern sea otters on the California coast; several State Marine Conservation Areas; and the kelp forests and rocky intertidal habitats considered to be some of the most diverse and abundant in the world.

No other proposed sanctuary alternative is adequate. The Draft Environmental Impact Statement acknowledges that all other alternatives would reduce the significant beneficial effects on biological resources provided by the Initial Boundary Alternative. All other alternatives would increase the vulnerability of those resources to adverse impacts that the Initial Boundary Alternative would prohibit or mitigate.

I specifically support the name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary” to honor the cultural history and stewardship of California Tribal peoples. The name will recognize Peoples that have lived on the California coast since time immemorial and protect the heritage of the Chumash, an ocean-going band among the First People of the Pacific Coast. We want to honor the late Chief Fred Collin’s nomination and vision for the sanctuary and the 10 years of work that the Northern Chumash Tribal Council
did to campaign for the sanctuary.

The CHNMS is an opportunity to advance environmental justice efforts. We ask that you keep the sacred connection between our ocean and community at the heart of this effort. The Sanctuary should teach the benefits of protecting our ocean and planet and promote the spirit of stewardship that is exemplified by the culture and history of the original Chumash caretakers.

I support equitable inclusion/representation of all Central Coast Tribes in the collaborative management of the CHNMS. By being equitable and inclusive, all sanctuary stakeholders will benefit from broad Indigenous input and TEK informing management.

Equitable collaborative management must be open to all Tribal groups interested in participating. This can best be accomplished with a Tribal Sanctuary Advisory Council made up of interested Tribal Groups. NOAA’s Tribal collaboration should be facilitated by a qualified Tribal Liaison.

I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary (CHNMS) with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I live in San Luis Obispo and frequently visit the coast to walk, run, paddle board, and boogie board. I grew up in Southern California and the the ocean has always been a special place for me and my physical and emotional health. I have two children who have also grown up with a deep love and respect for the ocean. I would like to see future generations have the same opportunity to enjoy and benefit from our oceans. 

I support the designation of the CHNMS because it would help protect and keep our oceans and its species safe and healthy. I would like to see the initial boundary alternative with the Gaviota Coast Extension. In addition, this is the first tribally led nominated sanctuary and would honor and respect tribal members who have stewarded the land and ocean for centuries. Please consider an equitable approach to include all Tribes in the Collaborative Management.

If the goal of the proposed sanctuary is to prohibit mineral extraction and recognize the Chumash, just leave it at that which would likely reduce controversy.

But do not grant any authority.

Dear Paul Michael,

My name is Dr. Cindy Lewis and my husband is Mr. Jeffrey Lewis, living in Templeton, CA. We strongly support establishing the largest possible Chumash Heritage National Sanctuary. 

I have a unique perspective about the Chumash Heritage Marine National Sanctuary (CHNMS), having grown up in San Luis Obispo in the 1960’s. My second year SLO High School biology class had weekly field trips to Montana de Oro, which was not even a State Park in 1965. My teachers inspired me to major in Marine Biology at Cal Poly, having taken courses with hundreds of hours of field trips up and down our beautiful coast. I saw intertidal black abalone and sand sharks in tidepools. Indeed, our coast was, and is, magical. I became a Marine Biologist, teaching and doing research for over 20 years.  

Between land development, pollution, global climate change which is warming and acidifying our oceans, and the overfishing of such animals as native abalone and oysters, our coastline is severely degraded. We MUST protect what we have NOW!

My husband and I attended the first NOAA presentations of the CHNMS in Morro Bay 8 years ago. We joined the Marine Protected Area Otter Watch program for years to gather data to protect our local otters. 

We support the largest possible contiguous boundaries as seen in the Initial Boundary Alternative combined with the Gaviota Coast Extension (Sub-Alternative 5b) because it provides the most protection to this crucial area. We do NOT support NOAA’s Alternatives 2, 3, or 4 which reduce the size and protection of the sanctuary by some 2,000 square miles, eliminating connectivity with the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, leaving out crucial cultural sites, including Morro Rock which is habitat for 2 endangered Peregrine falcon nesting pairs, and removing critical protections for marine habitat and species, including the threatened Southern sea otters. 
This largest proposed boundary ensures a contiguous buffer of ocean protection while directing offshore wind development to more suitable areas further offshore where wind energy is optimal and ecological and cultural impacts are reduced. The sanctuary will also allow for robust monitoring and research needed to understand the long-term impacts of offshore wind, including by Cal Poly Marine Biologists and their students.  Any offshore wind transmission cables proposed for this area as part of future offshore wind development should require permits from the National Marine Sanctuary Program to ensure that they are planned and sited in a thoughtful, consolidated manner to minimize impacts to the ocean. 

We support the name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary” to recognize people who have lived on this coast over 10,000 years, protect the heritage of the Chumash, an ocean-going band among the First People of the Pacific Coast and honor the late Chief Fred Collin’s nomination and vision for the Sanctuary and the 10 years of work that the Northern Chumash Tribal Council did to campaign for the Sanctuary. 

We oppose the proposed projects off Vandenberg based on serious environmental, cultural and permitting-process issues. The projects are irresponsibly sited too close to the shore, in a uniquely biodiverse location, with highly significant fisheries and unacceptable impacts to critical cultural sites. 

We support Sanctuary water quality programs and regulations that reduce pollution, by preventing harmful discharges and excessive runoff of sediments, oils, nutrients, pesticides, and pathogens. 

Do not carve out the Morro Bay area which includes one of the only functional tidal salt marshes left in California and our iconic Morro Rock that has ecological and cultural significance.  Instead, designate our CHNMS to be “complete” so Sanctuary administration oversees energy production and ecological impacts, rather than letting energy drive this system. 

This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to protect such a jewel of ecosystem diversity that provides fishing, recreational, research, cultural and educational prospects for future generations!  Who will protect our oceans if not us?

Sincerely,
Dr. Cindy Lewis and Mr. Jeffrey Lewis

I am strongly supportive of the proposed Chumash Marine Sanctuary. In live in Santa Barbara and believe that creation of the sanctuary with banning of extractive industries, with commercial fishing allowed but regulated by the Chumash would provide many benefits:
1) Recognition of the Chumash natives
2) protection of wildlife and together with the Channel Islands Marine Sanctuary create a great protected area which will benefit the complete food chain including humans through sustainable fisheries

Living as a guest on Chumash land has been truly been a blessing. The health of the coast and ocean has been significant to my own health and healing. There are countless physical, environmental, community, emotional, spiritual...etc threads I could write about and make connections to. But above all else, these places need to be protected and loved back into more health. I believe one of the most significant and courageous ways to do this is to return Indigenous lands to Indigenous stewardship in the most comprehensive and bold ways possible. Please listen to their leadership as it is the wisest thing to do to follow the lead of people who have had the longest relationship to this place. This is historic reckoning that benefits ALL communities. For this reason I strongly support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary.

I am writing to support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. The designation of the CHNMS should include the largest possible contiguous boundaries, the Initial Boundary Alternative with the Gaviota Coast Extension (Sub-Alt 5b), because it would provide the most protection to this important area. We do not support NOAA’s Alternatives 2, 3, and 4 because they would not protect a critical area of coastline that contains important Chumash cultural sites, marine habitat, and local communities.

First, please support the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary name. It is meant to recognize people who have lived on this coast for over 10,000 years; protect the heritage of the Chumash, an ocean-going band among the First People of the Pacific Coast; and provide a timely and appropriate reminder of the cultural origins. We support equitable inclusion of all Central Coast Tribes, both federally and non-federally recognized Tribes, in collaborative management. All sanctuary stakeholders will benefit from Indigenous input. 

It is vital that Sanctuary education and community outreach partner with area schools to share information about sanctuary species and habitats and Chumash history and culture. Outreach should be multilingual, culturally relevant, and should focus on underserved communities.

In addition, regulations to protect Rodriguez Seamount should move forward. The seamount provides critical habitat for an extremely diverse and abundant array of marine life and deserves to be granted strong and permanent protection. The seamount has special national significance that warrants special protections through sanctuary designation. Once damaged, fragile seamount ecosystems may not recover in our lifetime.

The proposed CHNMS will protect our beloved ocean now that Offshore Wind (OSW) farms are being established off the Central California Coast. Sanctuary designation is needed before OSW and other environmental impacts affect the habitat, wildlife, and water quality. California’s first offshore wind projects must reflect leasing, siting, and permitting decisions that are guided by planning and comprehensive scientific research on the potential impacts to sensitive marine areas and species and coastal resources, including cumulative impacts.

My name is Lyn and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats!

I live in Ventura, CA and to me, the ocean is where I always find myself coming back to, like my own home - similar to many of the cultures and creatures based around the ocean. 
 We depend on the ocean for recreation, our spiritual well-being, our community connections, and our economic health. The least we can do is offer protection. 

I want to protect this stretch of ocean so my community can continue to connect with and benefit from a clean, safe, and healthy ocean for years to come. 

The ocean is beautiful and mysterious. There is so much we’ve learned from it and much more to be learned. A sanctuary will be an important part of ocean research and education for present and future generations. The biodiversity and unique ecosystems that the ocean contains and supports is worth protecting. 

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes: 
Biggest Possible Boundary with Gaviota coast extension;
The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”;
Education, research, and further restoration opportunities; and definitely 
A prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries.

My name is Katie Franklin and I support the swift designation of the Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I live in and grew up in Los Osos and to me, the ocean is sacred and crucial to protect now more than ever.
We need to keep it clean and pristine.  Fish populations are dwindling.  We are in the midst of a mass extinction world wide.  
Nothing we do should endanger anymore life including in our oceans.  
Our community is here to appreciate the wilderness on land and water.
Allow the wilderness to repair and have respite from damaging human effects.
Wind power is not appropriate for the oceans.  Keep it out of the ocean.
The base of one wind power turbine is a football field.  And the migrations of whales and birds are crucial to keep safe.
The oils used to maintain the wind turbines are toxic.  Find a place on land for them.
Protect this natural treasure the central coast ocean with a preserve.  This part of the ocean is most important!  South of here has been tainted by oil rigs and many other sources of pollution!  We must include the central coast in the preserve and have a team to manage it that is completely dedicated to protecting it as there is for the Monterey Bay sanctuary.
A sanctuary will be an important part of ocean research and education for present and future generations.

I am a photographer living in Morro Bay, California, and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats. That includes the entire sanctuary as originally envisioned by the applicant, and not the current alternatives proposed which truncate the southern border of the sanctuary and carve out wide corridors that interrupt the continuity of the sanctuary.   It is important to establish a contiguous sanctuary that connects with the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary in the north.  A key goal is to prevent any oil or gas drilling off the coastline.  An accommodation can be made for cables necessary for offshore wind power, should those proposals come to fruition, that does not require bisecting the original plans.

With photographer Arthur Tress we are currently editing a book, ""100 Views of Morro Rock"" and what emerges is a portrait of a region that thrives in the area around ""Lisamu"" as the Chumash call the site. Its definition means ""place of great abundance, or source of great abundance for life around it"" and as the photos demonstrate, the sea life around the area thrives.  This needs to be protected as well, and ""Lisamu"" (Morro Rock) needs to be included in the protected area as well.

Thank you for allowing me to register my support of the project as the applicants originally envisioned it and for the full protection of this exquisite marine environment.

Yours truly,

Dear Paul Michel,
My name is Susan Christian and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.
I live in Atascadero, California and to me, the ocean is part of my life. I grew up on the beach. At the age of 7, my Bluebird girls group had our ‘beach day’ at Gaviota beach. We had family picnics at El Capitan. My kids surf at Morro Bay. San Simeon is my heart’s favorite hiking trail. I live in this district of the proposed sanctuary. Wildlife, the natural earth, needs to be respected. We live with this earth, and have the responsibility to help it thrive. 

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes all the clear issues below:
	•	Biggest Possible Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension
	•	Sanctuary Name: The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”
	•	Tribal Collaborative Management: An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management.
	•	Outreach & Education: Outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities
	•	Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity
	•	Ban Oil & Gas: A prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries
I really do support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

To: Paul Michel, Policy Coordinator at NOAA Sanctuaries West Coast Region
From: Eleanor Shannon

Dear Paul Michel,

My name is Eleanor Shannon, and I strongly support the designation of the Chumash Heritage Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I live south of the proposed sanctuary in Ojai, CA, and the reason I moved there was to be near the ocean. It is a priceless resource—a foundation for mental health, physical health, community, and simply knowing from its vastness how small human beings actually are and how much we depend on an eco-system bigger than we are. 

I fully support of the designation of the Chumash Heritage Marine Sanctuary. I have read the draft plan and agree with the statement that is expanded and explained in pages 6-12:  that this is an""... opportunity to raise public awareness of Indigenous cultures, incorporate traditional knowledge into sanctuary management, and protect resources essential to these cultures, was a core motivation in the nomination and ultimate designation of the sanctuary."" 
I am not a Chumash, but I volunteer for and support their activities, including the tomol canoe project, started by a group near where I live. This Sanctuary would have a direct positive affect on tribal groups but up and down the coast of California, and it would also center their knowledge and cultural heritage in a way that we can all benefit from in this era of Climate Change. It is impressive to read in the document about all the ways the Sanctuary will involve and support indigenous culture and know how through the various Action Plans, especially the first and second. 

I ask that:
. 
-	The sanctuary include the biggest possible boundary with the Gaviota Coast Extension. 

-	Be named, Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary because these areas are historically important to the Chumash tribes and the natural resources within them remain critically important to tribal heritage.

-	Include all Tribes in Collaborative Management

-	Create outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge and access for local underserved communities. 

-	Protect Rodriguez Seamount as an essential way of protecting biodiversity

-	Prohibit new oil and gas development within its boundaries

In sum, I assert my full support for the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge you and the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations of Americans and Californians to enjoy, protect, and benefit from the ocean as a multi-faceted resource—and one whose importance cannot be overstated. Time is of the essence. 

Sincerely,

Eleanor Shannon

I am a former board member of the Morro Bay National Estuary Program (MBNEP), SLO County MPA Watch Coordinator and SLO County Coastal Cleanup Coordinator.  I am now happily retired and have more time to enjoy kayaking, swimming and just strolling along the beach. 

I am so excited that we are nearing the finish line and an official sanctuary designation is close to becoming a reality. I can’t thank you enough for all of your efforts to move this process forward.  I am especially pleased with the decision to honor the Chumash people that have called this coastline home for over 10,000 years by including the tribe in the name of the sanctuary.  The Northern Chumash Tribal Council has also worked tirelessly to shepherd the sanctuary nomination to completion and deserves recognition for their efforts.  I sincerely hope that NOAA will continue to collaborate with both federally and non-federally recognized Central Coast tribes in the ongoing management of the sanctuary. 

I’m also very supportive of the proposed regulation of activities within the sanctuary, including the creation of a special Rodriguez Seamount Management Zone.  Restrictions on activities are essential for ensuring that the sanctuary fulfills its primary purpose as a refuge for the incredibly diverse and abundant marine life found within its boundaries, allowing them to thrive and flourish in perpetuity.  I would actually have preferred stronger regulations, such as restrictions on fishing and speed limits for ships, but realize those are more controversial.  

I do have one major reservation about the final proposal, however.  I strongly support the initial boundary that was submitted with the nomination which would protect 7,573 square miles of ocean and close the gap between the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary and Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary.  I do not support the agency-preferred alternative of reducing the size of the sanctuary by almost 2000 square miles by leaving the area between Cambria and Montana de Oro unprotected.  This alternative offers insufficient safeguards for the many migratory species that pass through this area, including birds, whales, fish, turtles and marine mammals.  Uncontrolled activities in that area, such as drilling, mining or dumping, could seriously undermine threaten marine life and the adjacent sanctuary.  I understand the conundrum posed by uncertainties associated with the development of the offshore wind farms.  If the wind energy corridor was already in place, it could be grandfathered in.  I understand the reluctance to create a precedent by allowing a wind energy cable corridor to be created after the sanctuary is established.  Nonetheless, I would urge you to continue to pursue a solution that will accommodate both the protection of the entire coastline and the successful implementation of the wind farms.  Protecting biodiversity and slowing climate change are the two biggest challenges of our time and we can’t afford to sacrifice either one. We must succeed at both.

I am writing here to support the creation of the Chumash National Marine Sanctuary because California's network of Marine Protected Areas (Marine Reserves, Parks, and Conservation Areas) have already proven themselves ecologically successful, most notably in the Channel Islands Marine Protected Area (MPA) and the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, where most fish stocks have increased in variety, biomass and size. Another report (cited below) indicates the same trend for several other commercially and recreationally fished species.

""Generally, baseline monitoring results show that California's MPAs are “on track” and that some species are already responding to protection.33 This is especially true in older MPAs that pre-date the MLPA planning process. 

""For example, mature fish including cabezon (Scorpaenichthys marmoratus), lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus) and black rockfish (Sebastes melanops) are more abundant in some Central Coast protected areas than in similar fished habitats, according to five-year findings.34 The endangered black abalone (Haliotis cracherodii)—which has not been harvested legally since 1993— increased in size inside Central Coast protected areas during the same time period.35 The North Central Coast baseline monitoring results show increased abundance of lingcod and several species of rockfish inside MPAs after five years.36 Additionally, red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) populations in the North Central Coast's Sea Lion Cove SMCA, which was designed to curb poaching and protect abalone, experienced a “sharp increase” in the first five years after the MPA was established in 2010.37,38""

But the ecological benefits to the proposed sanctuary will not be fully realized without also closing it to future oil and gas exploration. This crucial component of the sanctuary will not only prevent the kind of environmental degradation that occurred in the Santa Barbara oil spill of 1969, of which our coastline is only now recovering, it will have affirmative effect of giving the federal and local governments the tools to address the problem of ocean acidification while supporting California's plan to meet its climate change goals. Expanding fossil fuels exploration along California's most pristine and picturesque coastline would undermine my state's authority to fulfill its climate change agenda through future environmental regulation, while creating the sanctuary would respect our state's authority to protect our extremely sensitive coastline for future generations, as well as recognize our local Chumash community as the original stewards of our coastline and waters.

I think it's critical to preserve the entire coast from Monterey--including Morro Bay--from windfarms and degrading development for generations to come.

These projects should be planned and authorized in a way that avoids and mitigates impacts to sensitive marine areas, species, and important cultural areas. 

This Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary should protect the area from harmful oil and gas development and reduce water pollution in Sanctuary waters by preventing excess runoff of sediments, oils, pesticides, nutrients, and pathogens.

This Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary will elevate Indigenous perspectives and cultural values, honoring the history and culture of the Native Americans who have inhabited this region for more than 10,000 years.

My name is Rebecca Ravenoak and I support  the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundaries extending up the Gaviota Coast. That 7,600 square miles of ocean is precious habitat for the whales, the otters, and countless other marine species.

I live in Alameda county and I grew up in Orange County, near the beach. I got married at the beach. I spend every weekend I can at the beach, or fishing with my in-laws off the Monterey coast, or admiring the sunsets you can only find here. The land is both beautiful and rich, teeming with life in the kelp forests and the rocky bottoms. We must preserve it for the future.

The Chumash people have been stewards of this land for much much longer than any white people have even known about it. They are the rightful caretakers. Listen to them and heed their advice. The impacts of underwater noise and construction must not be underestimated, and progress for California can't come at the expense of her coasts. A wind farm off the coast would be ruinous for all of us.

I live in Corvallis, OR and lived in Santa Barbara, CA in the early 90s; so I remember the oil blob-polluted beaches and the stench well. I believe protecting the ocean is one of our last chances of preserving what's left of Nature as it used to and is supposed to be. Human impact has been bad enough already (found just this week: DDT, dead whales...), and it's high time we put a stop to degrading it further. Please remember that the genie cannot be put back into the bottle: much too often, we have waited too long (e.g., the effects of mining, oil exploration, sonar effects on animals....). Let our AND YOUR legacy for future generations include ay least some last-ditch efforts to prevent further damage. All of the potential energy produced cannot make up for the environmental destruction in the path of generating it.

There is also a factor of social justice involved; we have trampled on indigenous/native lands, our treaties with tribes ,and their rights long enough.
Let's put a stop to that in a meaningful way: ensuring a healthier future for as much of the CA coast as possible. Centuries, or probably already decades from now, doing so will be seen as prescient and wise, and the right thing to do, at a time when this area may well be one of the last healthy places to live for a large portion of US population. Please remember that we owe our kids and grand kids to do as much as is in our - YOUR - power to protect what is not only logical, but also irreplaceable, and last, but not least, sacred to so any who live there.

I strongly support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary be as large as suggested by the local/regional tribes, and that all types of industrial exploitation (oil, gas,...) be prohibited there.
In doing so, the Administration will allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and sustainably benefit from the Pacific’s many treasures without destroying it.

Thank you for any efforts to make this come true.

Sincerely,

Teresa Reinhardt",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

I am a resident of Washington State but I am writing in support of the Chumash Heritage Sanctuary.  I was so disappointed to read that NOAA had deleted this stretch of coast from the proposed sanctuary.  Trust me, I see a need for reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. Perhaps we can have wind farms and also protect the environment? If there are to be wind farms, measures can be made to protect the sea otters and other life of this area.  There would need to be strict regulation backed by science, but that and careful oversight might be able to make it work.  I encourage you to take a hard look at the issue and to see how both sides may be, at least, given some victory here. So much of the time, it isn't either/or but AND.  Make it happen, please.  We have lost so much already due to intransigence from the corporate side.  I am thankful that the Chumash are attempting to save what so many are willing to sacrifice.  Please do your best. The eyes of the future are on you to protect what is under assault. Regarding off shore mining-the industry hasn't advanced enough to take the risk. Any thoughts that they have are premature!!

The coast is the place where I go when I need to seek peace and tranquility. It is a place where I see the abundant life of the coast from human to crustacean and avian. It lifts my heart. The ocean is our partner and has mitigated some of our worst excesses of pollution and an overheating climate. It is up to us to protect the ocean and see that it is not over exploited and further trashed by our activities.  In the case of this proposed marine sanctuary,  we also have the opportunity to partner with Indigenous Tribes of California to steward a piece of our coastline. 

To that end, I support the creation of this sanctuary in it's originally proposed configuration: linking the Monterey Bay Sanctuary to the Channel Islands in one continuous reserve. I support the name ""Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary"". I support and encourage the partnership of Indigenous tribes and NOAA to administer and steward this area. I would like to see this area protected from future oil and gas development and seafloor mining.  On the issue of potential offshore wind development - I would like to see this happen in some form. We need to replace fossil fuels, but the development has to happen with the highest possible standards to prevent harm to organisms which live here including migrating whales, without harm to sacred sites, to the livelihood of fishers or detrimental impact on land. 

In light of the proposed floating wind farms off Morro Bay, I don't think this is a good reason to cut out a portion of the proposed sanctuary. If NOAA doesn't know what the effects of such a wind farm will be, why aren't we consulting with European Countries to see what effects they are seeing? Yes, it's in a different place in a different ocean, but it is likely to be similar equipment, so what can they teach us? This consultation should be done in conjunction with any planning for a wind farm, instead of doing this piecemeal and cutting a piece out of the proposed sanctuary because we don't know what will happen.

The establishment of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary should be based on an equitable approach to include all tribes in collaborative management. The Rodriguez Seamount needs to be protected.  And a prohibition on oil and gas development in sanctuary boundaries is critical.

In order to maintain the quality and quantity of the California coastal and near shore ecosystem the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary should run from the existing Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary to the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary and include a small number of floating windmills for ancillary industrial power on the shore.

A limited number, approximately 190, floating windmills could be considered for operation within the entire combined National Marine Sanctuary. Off shore floating windmills will endanger sea life with sonic pollution, while the attending cables will be a navigation hazard to all sea life that migrates within the combined National Marine sanctuary. A large number of off shore floating windmills will not address the need for green energy in the region. Solar power and batteries on individual buildings and properties will. 

A disturbed ocean and near shore environment will leave a non-natural barren ecosystem causing local heating and die-off of ocean species. Leaving the California coast and near shore environment in a natural state will decrease the effect of climate change by allowing the ocean to absorb much of the excess heat and some of the CO2 emissions caused by climate change. 

Creating the combined National Marine Sanctuary - from the existing Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary to the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary - will be a decisive step towards reducing the effect of climate change on the California coast.

My name is Maribel Louie and I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I live in Hermosa Beach, CA. The ocean is an important natural resource that must be preserved for current and future generations. Climate changes impacting the coast of California are increasingly ever-present. Careful stewardship of the land and in this case it’s surrounding waters is best done with the collaboration of the indigenous communities that have been stewards of the land and who have intimate knowledge of its needs and how to care and restore it for the benefit of all Californians. 

I understand that a portion of the originally mapped area has been left out of the preservation are with the intent for it to be used for a wind farm. I would urge you to reconsider the approach to this project and find a way to work collaboratively with the Chumash people to protect the most land possible. We have many urgent environmental needs, including more sustainable energy sources, but California must be at the forefront of finding solutions that prioritize the environment and it’s people first.

I believe that the Chumash Heritage Sanctuary should be approved.

The ocean stores 50 times more carbon dioxide than the atmosphere, and much of that is held in wetlands and seagrass beds such as are found in the Chumash area. This expanded sanctuary will help us heal the Earth, safeguarding this incredible biodiversity, and keeping ocean wildlife out of harm’s way.

I had an idea for making the underground cabling, that's necessary for wind farms off the coast, more environmentally sound.

As a native Californian, born in this magnificent state, I have always held a deep reverence for the diverse natural wonders that grace our region.

Last year, upon returning to California after many years away, I embarked on a memorable journey along Highway 101. The mesmerizing sights and the profound connection I felt with the land reignited my passion for environmental conservation and underscored the critical need to safeguard our delicate ecosystems.

I firmly believe that preserving our environment should take precedence over any economic interests. Indigenous tribes have an inherent, time-tested understanding of sustainable coexistence with nature, and their wisdom should guide our decisions regarding conservation. Their ancestral knowledge, coupled with modern scientific expertise, can pave the way for responsible and long-lasting stewardship of our precious ecosystems.

Morro Bay, with its rich biodiversity and unique coastal habitats, deserves to be preserved for future generations to admire and cherish. Establishing a wildlife sanctuary in this area would not only protect the flora and fauna but also provide an opportunity for educational enrichment, research, and responsible tourism.

I urge you to consider the lasting benefits of creating a wildlife sanctuary off Morro Bay, informed by the collective wisdom of indigenous communities and driven by a sincere commitment to the environment. Let us join hands to preserve the natural heritage that makes California truly extraordinary.

Thank you for your attention and consideration.

Dear Paul Michel,

My name is Sheryl
Porter and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I live in Yorktown, Virginia and to me, the ocean is a part of my life and something I hope will always be cherished and protected. The ocean is beautiful and mysterious. There is so much we’ve learned from it and much more to be learned. A sanctuary will be an important part of ocean research and education for present and future generations.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes a ban on oil and gas development within sanctuary boundaries.

I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

I strongly support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension. This will cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean that will ensure greater protection for biodiversity and ecological habitats.

I am a researcher at the University of California, Santa Cruz. My current research focuses on land use, water sustainability and climate change on California’s Central Coast. An additional area of interest is Native American environmental policy reflected in my 2003 dissertation as well a 2008 paper, “The Right to Habitat Protection,” published in Public Land & Resources Law Review. The Central Coast is a unique region, close to very large metropolitan areas, yet with many undeveloped areas that we need to cherish and protect from inappropriate development. 

As such, this sanctuary should encompass the largest possible boundary  (the Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension), the name should be  “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary” in honor of the Chumash efforts to sustainably manage the region for future generations, and oil and gas development should never be allowed.

My name is Ava Nguyen and I am writing to support the designation and extension of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I was born and raised in California, have lived here my whole life, and wouldn't leave for anywhere else in the world. I especially love our ocean and all the organisms that dwell inside it. I recently graduated from UC Santa Cruz, where I majored in Ecology & Evolution. Every day I saw the beautiful Monterey Bay while walking to the dining hall. Many of the courses I took were located at the Coastal Science Campus, located at the edge of Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, our nation's largest marine sanctuary. One of my fondest memories was walking with my friends in between classes to the overlook point, where we'd see sea lions, whales, and all manners of seabirds. The diversity of wildlife I saw amazed me; as a Southern Californian, I was unused to seeing many of these animals in the wild. The beach I went to as a kid and still frequent to this day, Seal Beach, has very seals left. Actually, I have never seen one there, despite looking for years. I therefore strongly advocate for marine sanctuaries that protect as much biodiversity as possible.

I also support the Chumash, a tribe that I actually did a report on in elementary school. Throughout the years I've kept reading on them; I remember in particular a heartbreaking Los Angeles Time article about how many of their buried artifacts are being lost to increasing sea levels due to climate change. I urge you to allow the Chumash to take part in fairly and equally managing their ancestral lands. I ask that this marine sanctuary not only protect our precious wildlife, but uplift communities and be used to educate all. Lastly, I support the ban of oil and gas development within the sanctuary. Thank you for reading!

I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

if we allow wind farms off shore to irresponsibly harm the surrounding ecosystem, we are risking a lot more then simply expanding the borders a bit. Should a wind farm interrupt whales migratory patterns, for example, whales could end up destroying the ecosystem by simply staying longer & continuing eating their natural prey; faster then it can rejuvenate, causing a massive disturbance in the food chain. The same could happen in reverse; to few whales & their prey’s population expands & causes their prey to die out from the growing demand of the bigger population 

basically, just expand the border man. it’s simple

As the world grapples with the existential threats posed by climate change and environmental degradation, the call to protect our marine ecosystems reverberates with increasing urgency. The proposed Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, covering the 'Alolkoy' (Initial Boundary Alternative) and the 'Shalawa' (Gaviota Coast Extension), stands as a testament to this urgency. This sanctuary is not merely a delineation on a map; it is a living, breathing entity that encompasses approximately 7,600 square miles of ocean, a sanctuary for life and Earth Mother's vital habitats.

The National Marine Sanctuaries Act (NMSA) serves as the foundational legislative framework for the establishment and management of marine sanctuaries in the United States. It grants the Secretary of Commerce the authority to designate areas of special national significance and mandates the preparation and periodic updating of management plans for each sanctuary. However, the NMSA is not an isolated piece of legislation; it exists within a complex web of laws and international agreements that shape our interaction with the ocean.

The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) provides a comprehensive international legal framework for the governance of the world's oceans. In 2023, the global community reached an agreement on a High Seas Treaty, an instrument added to UNCLOS, aimed at protecting marine biodiversity in international waters. This treaty sets a global precedent that amplifies the importance of marine sanctuaries and provides an international context within which the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary can be understood.

The Antiquities Act, another pivotal piece of legislation, has been instrumental in the designation of marine monuments like Papahānaumokuākea. It sets a federal precedent for the protection of marine resources and offers a legislative pathway that could be emulated for the Chumash sanctuary.

But what sets the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary apart is its profound connection to the indigenous Chumash people. The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) establishes a universal framework of minimum standards for the survival, dignity, and well-being of indigenous peoples. It elaborates on existing human rights standards as they apply to the specific situation of indigenous peoples, including their relationship with their ancestral lands and waters. The sanctuary thus becomes not just an environmental imperative but also a matter of indigenous rights, aligning with the principles laid out in UNDRIP.

The sanctuary should, therefore, be designed to honor this intricate web of relationships. Its boundaries should be expansive, in line with both the NMSA and the global commitments under UNCLOS. The name ""Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary"" should be retained to honor the indigenous peoples and their deep-rooted connection to these waters. An equitable approach to management should be adopted, integrating traditional ecological knowledge with modern scientific understanding, as per the guidelines of UNDRIP and the NMSA. Outreach and education programs should focus on making the sanctuary accessible to local underserved communities, democratizing oceanic knowledge and stewardship. The protection of unique geological features like the Rodriguez Seamount is crucial, aligning with the NMSA's objective to protect unique habitats. Finally, a stringent prohibition on new oil and gas development within the sanctuary boundaries should be enforced, as authorized by the NMSA and in alignment with global commitments to reduce fossil fuel extraction under various international agreements.

The urgency to act is now. The designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary is not merely a policy decision; it is a commitment to future generations, ensuring that the ocean remains a treasure for all to explore, appreciate, and benefit from. It is a commitment to the indigenous Chumash people, whose heritage is deeply intertwined with these waters. And it is a commitment to the world, signaling that we are ready to take the steps necessary to protect our planet for the generations to come.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has been at the forefront of global conservation efforts, advocating for protected areas that are effectively managed and fairly governed. The IUCN's World Commission on Protected Areas emphasizes the importance of recognizing the roles and custodianship of indigenous peoples and local communities in conservation efforts. This aligns seamlessly with the sanctuary's objectives, as it aims to integrate Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) in its management practices.

The sanctuary's proposed designation also resonates with the principles of the Marseille Manifesto, which calls for an ambitious, interconnected, and effective site-based conservation network.

 I feel it is extremely important to protect the specific area of Morro Bay from offshore windfarm development until such time as more is understood about the impact of offshore wind and its infrastructure on sea creatures, especially mammals, especially sea otters.

The original proposal from the Chumash tribe included Morro Bay, which has rich biodiversity including a population of endangered sea otters. It is also a significant area to the tribe. 
The exclusion of this area from the proposed sanctuary is not only unfortunate for the wildlife and ecology there, but a slap in the face to the people who have worked for years towards its creation.
I am certainly in favor of sustainable energy production. However there must be ways found to generate electricity without the environmental destruction that has accompanied oil and gas drilling, coal mining,  dam building and deforestation for solar farms.
As I see it, there is a prevalent myth that because lots of electricity is needed, lots of big machines and big installations must be employed to produce it. In reality, electricity is constantly produced all around us, by natural forces as well as by life itself.
These myriad generators haven't yet been harnessed in the numbers needed. Nor has there been any incentive to decentralize the power grid to include multiple smaller electricity sources, which would create a grid with vast resilience instead of the vulnerability we have currently. Imagine every home, every roof, every highway median, every office building and parking lot creating, gathering and contributing electricity. This is possible, the technology exists. It is sustainable. It destroys none of the increasingly scarce habitat remaining for the millions of other species that share our only home, Earth.
In the meantime, it is imperative that precious places, animals and habitats be protected from development that would compromise them further by intruding devices, equipment and materials into sensitive habitat without any idea what impacts it could have.

I am writing to you to express my wholehearted support for the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension, covering approximately 7,600 square miles of ocean. As a resident of San Luis Obispo, California, the ocean holds a special place in my heart. Whenever I visit the coast, I cherish moments kayaking, exploring the beach, and observing the vibrant marine life. As a surfer, sport fisherman, kayaker, diver, and outrigger canoe paddler, the ocean is not just a playground for me, but a sanctuary that enriches my life and strengthens the bonds within my family.

The ocean is our shared heritage, a source of endless wonder and joy for my family. It's where young people learn the importance of nature, conservation, and respect for all living beings. Preserving this stretch of ocean is not just a choice; it's an essential responsibility. It's about safeguarding the legacy we pass on to our children and the generations that follow. Each wave I catch, every fish I reel in, every stroke of my paddle, and every dive beneath the surface reminds me of the delicate balance of our marine ecosystems. It reinforces the urgent need to protect and nurture these waters, ensuring that the vibrant life they hold continues to thrive.

I wholeheartedly endorse the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the following key components:

Biggest Possible Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension.
Sanctuary Name: Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary.
Tribal Collaborative Management: An inclusive approach that incorporates the wisdom of all Tribes in Collaborative Management.
Outreach & Education: Robust programs promoting Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and ensuring access for underserved local communities.
Rodriguez Seamount: Protection of Rodriguez Seamount, crucial for preserving biodiversity.
Ban Oil & Gas: Prohibition of new oil and gas development within sanctuary boundaries.
I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary promptly. This sanctuary will not only be a haven for present generations but also a vital resource for future ones, fostering enjoyment, protection, and benefit from our ocean's invaluable treasures.

My name is Sharon Bondy and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats. However, I strongly suggest that the ORIGINAL proposed sanctuary boundary be reconsidered for approval. The original plans to have the Chumash Heritage NMS extend to the Monterey Bay NMS would vastly improve the protections for marine life and prevention of future offshore drilling on the California Coast. This original proposal secures our oceans for endangered and once-endangered animals like Sea Otters and Northern Elephant Seals, guaranteeing them a stable future by bridging the Channel Islands NMS and the Monterey Bay NMS without leaving a perilous gap at Morro Bay.

I live in Irvine and the ocean is personally important to me. We depend on the ocean for recreation, our spiritual well-being, our community connections, and our health.
I want to protect this stretch of ocean so my community can continue to connect with and benefit from a clean, safe, and healthy ocean. A sanctuary will be an important part of ocean research and education for present and future generations.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary and to extend to the Monterey Bay NMS. I ask that this sanctuary includes: 
* Biggest Possible Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension and extend to the Monterey Bay NMS
* Ban Oil & Gas: A total prohibition on oil and gas development within sanctuary boundaries
* Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity

This sanctuary should protect the area from harmful oil and gas development and reduce water pollution in Sanctuary waters by preventing excess runoff of sediments, oils, pesticides, nutrients, and pathogens.

The Marine Sanctuary should ensure that Offshore Wind operations and construction are banned to avoid and mitigate impacts to sensitive marine areas, species, and important cultural areas.

This original proposal secures our oceans for endangered and once-endangered animals like Sea Otters and Northern Elephant Seals, guaranteeing them a stable future by bridging the Channel Islands NMS and the Monterey Bay NMS without leaving a perilous gap at Morro Bay. It would also give indigenous leaders more power over a larger swath of the coastline and off-shore areas, which are lands and waters that still belong to them and which must be managed with the help of their generations of expertise and wisdom. If the current proposal moves forward, it will leave Morro Bay's fragile marine ecosystem open to destruction, limit indigenous sovereignty, and severely hamper interconnected conservation efforts on our beautiful California coastline.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary including an extension to Monterey Bay NMS. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

My name is Jeanette  Howe and I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.
I live in San Antonio, TX, which is a few hours drive from some coastal waters, and to me the ocean is our source. We live on the only planet known to have stable bodies of water on its surface. The ocean generated our species and it gives us the water and minerals we are made of and oxygen we breathe and food we need to live. The other plant and animal species that live in it help us live too.
Though I am not near the same ocean coast, because we are all interconnected and dependent upon the ocean, I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes the biggest possible boundary, inclusive of the Gaviota Coast Extension, protection of Rodriguez Seamount to protect biodiversity, prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries, the name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”, an equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management, and outreach, education and research programs that provide both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities.
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary as outlined above.

Living in the Monterey area where the coast is protected is very different from living in other places of California where the Ocean and beaches are not protected.

I am writing in support of the proposed Chumash Heritage National Marine Sancturary. I understand that the boundaries of the future sanctuary, as proposed by NOAA, exclude the area specifically targeted for protection by the Chumash people. I am very concerned about this, because NOAA's stated reason for excluding this area is to accommodate wind farms. NOAA itself has acknowledged that wind farms and related developments could ""increase ocean noise, change existing habitats, affect life cycles of fish, change species survival rates, and release contaminants that could be absorbed by marine life."" (The Guardian, ""Indigenous Tribe reels after exclusion from US Marine Sanctuary,"" 10/1/23)

I am very fortunate to live on the Monterey Bay (in Aptos, CA). In the years since this area was protected as a marine santuary we have seen the many benefits, including a rebound of the sea otter population and reduction in human activities that adversely affect the marine ecosystem. Tourists flock to the Monterey Bay Aquarium to marvel at the wonders of ocean life in this area, and many are inspired to become involved in efforts to protect it. These newly made commitments are a bare shadow of the Chumash people's milennia of stewardship of their traditional lands. I urge you to include the lands they have targeted for governmental protection in the new Marine Santuary.

Thank you for your consideration.

Many cultures have a deep spiritual or religious bond with the ocean and protecting the coast is just one way we can respect the indigenous peoples who have worked so hard to make this sanctuary a possibility.

I am very, very upset that the coastline between Morro Bay and Cambria is not included in the final proposed area of the NMS, in spite of the insistence of the Chumash Nation that this land should also be protected. I have spent a lot of time in this area for someone who lives so far away, and there are few places I have been in this great country of ours that are more deserving of protection. 

I would like to see the protection of the biggest possible boundary (The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension and protection of Rodriguez Seamount) with the Chumash Tribe able to fully cooperate in the sanctuary’s management. 

Do what is right. Protect these sacred waters and the diverse (and endangered) species that exist here, so that future generations will get to experience, appreciate, and learn from such a beautiful and important place.

I live in Morro Bay and to me, the ocean is a delicate array of life that needs our protection. I have lived in the Central Coast for about 6 years now I enjoy the wildlife, fauna and serenity that this area provides. I am quite blessed to be able to kayak, and walk among true Natives of this land. 
We have a dependency upon the ocean, and the wildlife and all of the plants and other living beings, that depend upon us to protect them. 
I do realize our need for sustainable energy, but it must not come at the expense of those which have no voice to speak.
I want to protect this stretch of ocean so my community can continue to

 Dear Paul Michel,
My name is David L. Yohe and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.
I live in Morro Bay and to me, the ocean is a delicate array of life that needs our protection. I have lived in the Central Coast for about 6 years now I enjoy the wildlife, fauna and serenity that this area provides. I am quite blessed to be able to kayak, and walk among true Natives of this land. 
We have a dependency upon the ocean, and the wildlife and all of the plants and other living beings, that depend upon us to protect them. 
I do realize our need for sustainable energy, but it must not come at the expense of those which have no voice to speak.
I want to protect this stretch of ocean so my community can continue to 
connect with and benefit from a clean, safe, and healthy ocean.
The ocean is beautiful and mysterious. There is so much we’ve learned  
from it and much more to be learned. A sanctuary will be an important part

My name is Robert Kvaas and I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I live in Goleta, CA. and as a scientist, we know the ocean is now one of the most critical factors in slowing global climate change.  I want to protect this stretch of ocean so my community is doing its part in maintaining our regional section of ocean environment.  The Marine Sanctuary will help protect the balance of physical and biological diversity which still exists in this region of the coast.  There is so much we’ve learned from it and much more to be learned. A sanctuary will be an important part of ocean research and education for present and future generations.  Several campuses of the University of California and City Colleges like that at Santa Barbara have excellent marine focused degrees and research programs which will benefit from the proximity of this Sanctuary.

As a supporter of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, I would like to see this sanctuary include Tribal Collaborative Management to take advantage of the traditional knowledge possessed by the nearby Native American tribes who have lived in this region for thousands of years.  The sanctuary should focus on education and research programs to help us understand how the natural flora and fauna are maintaining the ecological balance of the region.  And finally, I would like to see the largest possible boundary (Initial Boundary Alternative) with the Gaviota coast Extension.  The Rodriguez Seamount inclusion is essential to protect biodiversity and help us understand the unique role these features play in ocean dynamics.  It goes without saying that a prohibition on new oil and natural gas development within sanctuary boundaries is also essential.

To sum up, I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary and urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many life sustaining properties.

My name is Nicky Leach, and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension, to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I now live in Santa Fe, New Mexico, but am a former longtime resident of Santa Barbara, California, and still an annual visitor to the Central Coast around Morro Bay and Big Sur. To me, the ocean in this still wild area is special, not only for its beauty, wildness, and coastal and marine life but because of the area's rich indigenous history. The two are intertwined here in a unique way, and it has given me great joy to know that the Chumash tribe have been working hard for a long time now to protect resources in this region for all. 

Every year, I travel two days by car to get to this stretch of coast - an 18-hour journey - just to walk Morro Bay Beach from Morro Rock on a daily basis, enjoy its sweeping beauty, crashing waves, sandy beach, and the birdlife onshore and off, the otter family in the harbor, the fishing boats, fresh fish, and the tranquil views of the Pacific. It is a place of physical and spiritual renewal that I look forward to having every year, and indeed need for my health, as I am living with a chronic health condition that benefits greatly from access to the beach and ocean. 
It is unimaginable that it could in any way be impacted by offshore development. That is already an issue in the Santa Barbara Channel, with so many oil platforms spoiling that channel and oil patches on the beaches. Although a cleaner energy, the density of wind farms would certainly ruin the viewshed of the Central California coastline, as it has in many parts of Europe and Scandinavia. 

I want to protect this stretch of ocean so we can all continue to connect with and benefit from a clean, safe, and healthy ocean. The ocean is beautiful and mysterious. There is so much we’ve learned from it and much more to be learned. A sanctuary will be an important part of ocean research and education for present and future generations.

The ocean is a place to be protected.

My name is Jonathan and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I am a lifelong resident of California living in Los Angeles, and I have a great love for our California coastline. California has an awe-inspiring natural beauty rooted in the unparalleled biodiversity of our ocean and the marine life that calls the California coastline home. As a child I was fascinated by the sea life I could see exposed in tide pools, and as I grew older I realized there was a wealth of incredible life just off the coast, home to kelp forests, migratory whales, sea otters, and so much more. As climate change heats our oceans and acidifies the water, I believe we must preserve the full range of habitats that nature has gifted to us. A sanctuary will be an important part in protecting our ability to learn and inspire this generation and the next.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes the biggest possible boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension, including Morrow Bay. I also ask that proposals for offshore wind development in this area be critically evaluated to have little to no impact to the marine life that calls this stretch of coastline home. Human development has long-term generational impacts on pristine marine habitats that I believe should be eliminated if at all possible. There are other stretches of the California coast that have already been heavily affected by human activity, and I believe that industrial projects should seek to avoid disturbing the beautiful marine habitats that would be covered by the largest possible boundary for the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary.

My name is Flora Lu, and I work as a professor of Environmental Studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz. I write you today in enthusiastic support of the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

As a scholar, my work centers Indigenous stewardship and sovereignty, issues at the heart of this matter. We know that settler colonialism and racial capitalism are the root causes of climate change and environmental degradation. We cannot protect or preserve the ecological systems upon which our lives depend without recognizing how issues of equity and justice are integral to environmental policy. I was disheartened to learn that NOAA had left out the stretch of coastline from Cambria to Morrow Bay as part of the marine sanctuary. This area, part of the traditional lands of the Chumash, should be off limits to oil drilling, deep sea mining, and wind farm development. NOAA must demonstrate its commitment to partnering with Indigenous peoples and forge a respectful co-management relationship with the Chumash, which begins with honoring their wishes for the territorial designation and acceptable uses of the coastal ecosystem. 

Specifically, I strongly urge you to support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes:

I did junior lifeguards on those waters and learned about the fragile ecosystem and what it means to be good stewards of the environment from those shores. We depend on the ocean for recreation, our spiritual well-being, our community connections, and our economic health.
I want to protect this stretch of ocean so my community can continue to connect with and benefit from a clean, safe, and healthy ocean. A sanctuary will be an important part of ocean research and education for present and future generations.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes:

Biggest Possible Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension
Sanctuary Name: The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”
Tribal Collaborative Management: An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management.
Outreach & Education: Outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities

Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity

Ban Oil & Gas: A prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension, to cover the approximately 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

It is very important to me that this sanctuary includes the largest possible boundary, which means the Initial Boundary Alternative with the Gaviota Coast Extension and the protection of Rodriguez Seamount, which is essential to protect biodiversity. The wealth of sea life in this stretch of coastline, if protected in the ways the indigenous tribes would protect it, will serve not only Californians, but will have benefits for sea life and the environment far, far from here, benefiting countless beings, and life everywhere. 

Indigenous wisdom always takes the longest view for the broadest benefits for all life, and if we honor and follow that wisdom, I believe we have the very best chance possible of healing the climate crisis before it is a complete climate catastrophe. Protecting our deep cold waters in a warming world can make it a place of refuge for species of all kinds, especially seabirds and ocean plant species, from the tiniest phytoplankton to the tallest kelp. Kelp are some of the most effective carbon sinks we have, and can do far more for the environment than offshore wind farms, which will cause unconscionable harm to wind-dependent seabirds and the many roles they play in fertilizing ocean plant life and maintaining biodiversity. It is also absolutely essential to prohibit new oil and gas development within sanctuary boundaries if any of these goals are to be met. 

In honor of all they’ve done to bring about the creation of this sanctuary, I would strongly support naming it the “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary.” And drawing on their wisdom once again, I support using a tribal collaborative management model, an equitable approach that would include all tribes in collaborative management. We will all benefit from this. In that same vein, outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge and access for local underserved communities will benefit all of us too.

The designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary gives me great hope for the future. Please do all you can to make this happen for the health and wellbeing of current and future generations, and for the earth itself.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

This stretch of ocean doesn’t belong to us humans - it belongs to itself.  And yet we get to make decisions on the ocean’s behalf.  It is essential to protect this stretch of ocean like we would protect our parents, or our children, or ourselves because it is essential to our survival.

The Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary would protect the ecosystems and species important to the beauty and ecological functions of the region. The sanctuary would also protect the cultural heritage and traditions of the Chumash tribe.

The Chumash tribe are the traditional custodians of their area, including the sea. Their role in Tribal Collaborative Management must be honored and valued. The exemption of a key stretch of coast that has great cultural value to the Chumash tribe does the opposite. Environmental and social justice in establishing the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary means drawing the largest possible boundary of the Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension, genuine participation through Tribal Collaborative Management, Outreach & Education programs, protection of the Rodriguez Seamount, and Banning Oil & Gas exploration and development within sanctuary boundaries.

Once established, this will be the first marine sanctuary to have been nominated by an American Indian tribe. It will also represent a shared approach—wherein both federal and tribal government will be explicitly included in the management of the site—the first such arrangement ever. Undoubtedly, this is an important win for the cause of Native American tribal sovereignty. However, in  the draft management plan, the agency throws very cold water on the hopes that the federal government will honor its promise of shared decision-making. The stretch of ocean territory the agency would include in the sanctuary is remarkably shorter than the area proposed by the Chumash nation. The reason given: the area proposed—and fought for by the tribe for 15 years—would conflict with a wind energy project. Under this logic, all an energy company would need to do to limit the federal government’s authority to conserve American land and water would be for it to have a proposed project that may be built to completion at some point in the future (ocean-based wind projects are often abandoned as the true financial costs of deployment begin to outstrip the potential benefit of the energy to be produced). The agency would have the public lose forever the chance to properly protect a truly unique ecosystem (of tremendous cultural and spiritual significance to American Indians and non-Indians throughout California and across the nation—for the possibility of a wind farm, whose backers admit they have not answered key questions regarding the impact that the transmission technology will have on the surrounding ecosystem. The agency sets the troubling precedent that it is the sanctuary that conflicts with the wind project—and not the other way around. It thus gives primacy to corporate interests at the expense of the stated preference of the Chumash. What’s more, the agency asserts that it did not find the arguments for the tribe’s proposed boundaries compelling. These perspectives are the opposite of partnership. By dismissing the perspective of the Chumash, who have more experience and knowledge of the region and the sanctuary project than any other stakeholder, the agency undermines faith that the federal government will actually heed tribal positions in the future. If the government opts to pursue this plan, it will be a departure so far away from tribal wishes that one wonders why even name it for the Chumash. American Indian nations are not brands whose name should be slapped onto a development project if that project conflicts with tribal intent in supporting said project. I am disappointed that yet once again the federal government appears to be backtracking on its promises to tribes—and in doing so, making it that much harder for all Americans to hold faith in government. Please revisit the area to be protected, as the proposed plan is wholly inadequate for the task at hand and may actually harm federal-tribal relationships, which would deny the nation the chance to enjoy the expected benefits and improved ecological outcomes that make this such an important project in the first place.

I wanted to take this time to write to you regarding the sanctuary status which was not included for the MORRO area that is special to the Chumash people. The exclusion of the Morrro area threatens more than just a casual impact. A lot of sensitive areas cannot sustain wind farms for birds in the air,, Or underground structures interfering with interference for  sea life, and these structures will also leak toxic chemicals. So the sanctuary status is so necessary for the sensitive area, that I wish you would reconsider designating this as a sanctuary. It is not easy to go against the majority when a position such as yours. But I’m sure you would be able to find the strength to weather the storm, perhaps, of unpopular views on this very very importantt marine area.  Wind farms create so much damage irreparably, and any other further considerations use for non-environmentally compliant and unsafe environmental practices, which are iffy to begin with should be taken to heart. It takes a lot of courage to go against the green, and I urge you to please take some time to weigh all the options. I was really hate to see this area industrialized. Not withstanding the impact. Any non-sanctuary status would mean Chumash people would lose out, historically, culturally, and sacredly. What of these colonized people that we have destroyed so totally? The past has woman itself into the present, and the present will leave itself into the future. L is it really worth it  for this rather small area to be ruined? Please please be a pioneer for this environmental status and protection of this vital area. So many reasons to define the status quo and leave a brilliant mark environmentally. You won’t regret it. I encourage you to take the time you need to save the MORRO area And designated a marine sanctuary. Thank you very much for your time. Sincerely, SHERI.

The Chumash people have lived with and studied this region of ocean. The Chumash scientists and cultural historians are more completely informed about the nature of this region than those who are examining the benefits of wind farms on the state economy. It does not make sense to destroy a region of such diversity in order to develop clean energy. 
California is known for its tourism. Tourism is an incredible boon to the state economy. Clean fish, clean waters, and the natural environment are much better for the lives of people living in California. 
I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.
I study ocean flora and fauna for my work. The interrelationship of all of these organisms is necessary for my understanding of the world. During the pandemic I witnessed the disruption caused by recreational motors on a protected ocean inlet in Maine: the eagles didn’t raise their young, the herons didn’t come, the terns, lions and cormorants didn’t nest. There were no osprey in this heritage region because of the noise. The mussel and oyster lines were damaged and this affected local people’s livelihoods. The horseshoe crabs, a critical component of our medical vaccine and blood testing industry, were driven away. Without sufficient horseshoe crabs we lose our ability to make medicine for injectable antibiotics and other protections again pathogens. All this lost just from the noise people made in one 4 mile stretch of protected ocean during the summer of 2020. The ocean needs greater protections than we have given it.

I support the prompt designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctury with the original proposed boundary (Initial Boundary Alternative) and the Gaviota Coast Extension (sub alternative 5b) to protect the largest possible area of the ocean and coastline and the marine biodiversity and habitats included in those areas.  
I live in Lompoc, California and I moved to the Central Coast area specifically to get involved in marine conservation.  Our oceans are dying and we humans are the ones killing them.  Supporting the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary is a major step in protecting the ocean, the marine life and their habitats.  I frequently do solo beach clean-ups at Surf Beach, Ocean Beach and Jalama Beach and besides the trash that I pickup, the amount of tar on the beaches from the existing off shore oil rigs is astounding.  By enacting the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, we need to ban any new oil or gas development within the sanctuary, which is why we need to make the boundaries as large as we possibly can!  I would prefer that we decommission the existing oil rigs, but that is a topic for another day.
Alternatives 2, 3 and 4 reduce the size of the sanctuary, and the protections it would provide, by roughly 2,000 square miles.  They eliminate the connection with the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, opening up that area to damage, particularly from offshore wind development.  It also removes sanctuary protection for the threatened species of Southern sea otter.  While I support investigating offshore wind as an alternative to fossil fuel energy, it needs to be done in a way that least impacts the marine biodiversity.  There are multiple species of whales and other marine mammals that migrate along the central coast and these off shore wind platforms and transmission cables pose a threat to their migration, both in the Morro Bay 399 Wind Energy Area and ones proposed off Vandenberg SFB, right here in Lompoc.  The proposed Vandenberg sites are too close to shore and would impact marine biodiversity, fisheries as well as off shore cultural sites.  Additionally, removing Morro Bay from the sanctuary boundary excludes Lisamu’, also know as Morro Rock, which is a significant part of the Chumash cultural heritage.  As an ocean going people, the ocean is their mother and they have lived in this area for estimates of over 10,000 years and Lisamu’ is a sacred site for the Chumash.
I urge NOAA to retain the name of Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary.  Yes, there are other tribes in the area, but the Northern Chumash have spearheaded this effort for over a decade.  The late Fred Collins and current Chairwoman Violet Sage Walker have tirelessly worked to bring this sanctuary to fruition.  To name it anything else is an affront to their efforts and to the Chumash nation.  Furthermore, I find it offensive that NOAA is stating that it must work only with “federal recognized” tribes.  It is a slap in the face to Chairwoman Sage Walker and the Northen Chumash, who have spearheaded this effort, simply because they do not have a federal tribe designation.  And to my knowledge the Santa Ynez Chumash have not been involved in the process at all so to now bring them in as a titular nation is insulting.
If renaming the sanctuary would eliminate issues with the Salinen tribe then I have a suggestion.  Since most of the existing sanctuaries have geographic names (Monterey Bay, Channel Islands, etc.) why not make the name geographic as well.  I would like to suggest the Lisamu’ Central Coast National Marine Sanctuary as the name.  By including Lisamu’ (Morro Rock) in the sanctuary as outlined in the Initial Boundary Alternative this satisfies the desires of the Chumash people and allows NOAA to recognize the cultural significance of Morro Rock to the Chumash people as well as other tribes.  By naming the sanctuary after a geographic area (Morro Rock) but using the Chumash name – Lisamu’, you are also recognizing the Chumash heritage without naming any particular tribe.  But you would have to include Morro Bay and Morro Rock within the sanctuary boundaries.

Additionally, I do support the Tribal Collaborative Management so that ALL INTERESTED tribes can participate in the management of sanctuary.  In my UC Climate Stewards course, we learned a great deal about TEK (Traditional Ecological Knowledge) and how we can use it to restore the land.  Using the sanctuary for outreach and education will further the use of TEK to protect the land as well as marine habitats.
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary and I urge NOAA and the administration to designate the sanctuary to protect our coast for future generations to come.
Thank you.

I am a supporter of the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect marine habitats.
I am a retired teacher from Vallejo, California, and I feel a deep connection to the ocean.

I also believe that ocean research is important for educating present and future generations.

I also urge you to include all the tribes who are culturally connected to that area in collaborative management. Outreach, education and research programs should include both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and should be accessible to local underserved communities.
The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity.  New oil and Gas development should be prohibited within sanctuary boundaries
I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to benefit from the protection of our oceans.

The bay in general, and Morro Rock in particular, is not just a historically-sacred place, it is still held sacred today both by the Chumash and Salinan peoples. Its sacredness to these groups is so well-established that they have an ongoing dispute with one another about whether the rock should ever be climbed, with the Salinan climbing it twice per year to celebrate the solstices, and the Chumash believing that it should never be climbed. Moreover, archeology near Morro Bay establishes that the Chumash, at least, had been living in the area for over 3000 years, only a few thousand feet from the Rock.

When NOAA claims that ""The preferred boundary also allows NOAA to focus its management on key areas historically important to the Chumash tribes and natural resources important to their heritage,"" it seems like a bizarre claim. The agency is not primarily run by Chumash people, so we don't have any reason to think that NOAA's position reflects any insider knowledge about what's important to the Chumash. And the Chumash themselves have asked repeatedly for protection of the waters off this site, so it seems clearly just plain false to say that it's really for their sake that NOAA is ignoring this part of their request.

But I don't understand which other stakeholder either, that the exclusion is supposed to benefit. I don't see how it can possibly actually be the stated wind-farm-related concerns about ""subsea electrical transmission cables and substations from the Morro Bay Wind Energy Area to shore"". Those concerns do not seem applicable to Morro Bay, because the wind energy area is closer to Cambria than it is to Morro Bay. Laying the cables from the turbines all the way to Morro Bay at all would take several extra miles of undersea cables. It seems more efficient to onshore at Cambria, or perhaps further up the road.

Nor do I understand the ecological rationale. NOAA's plan has already shown at Graviota that the protection of coastline is an important goal of the sanctuary; deliberate choices in this boundary have been made to include the waters off other state parks, in the Marine protected area. And that makes very good sense: by protecting an adjacent pair of waters and the lands, a larger overall protected zone is created, each side supporting the other. Well, this applies directly to Morro Bay; there's a state park already right there in it, called Morro Bay State Park. I can see it right there on Google Maps. There's an otter-viewing pier and a State Marine Reserve, so there's clearly wildlife to protect... but apparently, it is the position of NOAA that none of this wildlife is worth protecting? Or that the adjacent wildlife is not worth protecting, as a support for the state reserves? I do not understand the intent.

It is heartening, though, that this sanctuary is happening at all.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

Paul Michel, NOAA Sanctuaries West Coast Regional Office, 99 Pacific Street, Building 100F, Monterey, CA 93940

Dear Paul Michel,

I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I live in Sonoma County and am a Naturalist and long-time conservationist, very familiar with our California coast and waters.

Honoring the Chumash tribal request is most important.

The ocean is also personally important to me. We depend on the ocean for recreation, our spiritual well-being, our community connections, and our economic health.
I want to protect this stretch of ocean so my community can continue to connect with and benefit from a clean, safe, and healthy ocean.
The ocean is beautiful and mysterious. There is so much we’ve learned from it and much more to be learned. A sanctuary will be an important part of ocean research and education for present and future generations.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. This designation will protect one of the most sensitive and beautiful areas of the world with exceptional sea life and ocean features.

The sanctuary should include the Chumash proposed full sanctuary and be named “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary” - with Tribal Collaborative Management: An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management.

For Outreach & Education, I support programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities

Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity

Ban Oil & Gas: A prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries is critically important.

In summary, I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

This designation will be one of your agency's most important. We must seek renewable energy solutions that do not negatively impact our California coast and we must make decisions to prioritize equity and fully protect our oceans, sanctuary areas and the fragile lives struggling to survive there

Sincerely,

The ocean is beautiful and mysterious. There is so much we’ve learned from it and much more to be learned.

Dear Paul Michel,

My name is Catherine Edwards and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I live in Santa Fe, NM, but grew up in California. The ocean is personally important to me. We depend on the ocean for recreation, our spiritual well-being, our community connections, and our economic health. Leaving this stretch of coast without protection may mean the destruction of habit for endangered sea otters and affect California tourism. For example, wind farms in this area will be a blight on the beauty of the drive up CA 1 and will kill thousands of sea birds, which already are under terrible strain from avian flu. Tourists will not wish to visit places with windfarms. They completely mar the beauty of the coastline. Another example that could blight the area are oil platforms which pollute the surrounding waters, leave tar on the beaches and leak, causing devastation to wildlife. It is important to protect this stretch of ocean to protect the health of the planet, whales, dolphins, birds and sea life that depend on a healthy ocean for survival.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes the Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension; the sanctuary name: “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary""; as well as Tribal Collaborative Management and outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities. I also support the protection of Rodriguez Seamount which is essential to protect biodiversity; and finally a ban on oil and gas development within sanctuary boundaries.

I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.
 
Sincerely,
Catherine Edwards

I live in Palos Verdes, CA and to me, the ocean restores my energy. I walk and hike near the ocean, my family sails and paddle boards in the ocean. We enjoy sustainable caught seafood and heals our soul! 

I support the largest proposed boundary, the Initial Boundary Alternative with the Gaviota Coast Extension (Sub-Alternative 5b), to ensure a contiguous buffer of ocean protection while directing Offshore Wind development to more suitable areas further offshore where wind energy is optimal and ecological and cultural impacts can be reduced. The sanctuary will also allow for robust monitoring and research needed to understand the long-term impacts of Offshore Wind. Any Offshore Wind transmission cables proposed for this area as part of future offshore wind development should require permits from the National Marine Sanctuary Program to ensure that they are planned and sited in a thoughtful, consolidated manner to reduce and mitigate impacts to
the ocean.

There is so much diverse wildlife, migrating, whales, and birds that frequent the coast at different times of the year. There is such a diverse and pristine, marine life system as well as the largest and last remaining healthy kelp forests.  In the area between Cambria and Morro Bay, there has been an incredible rebound of the endangered otter species. I think it’s incredibly important that the original border is considered and adopted for the sanctuary, making it contiguous with the Monterey Bay national Marine sanctuary. In addition, Morro rock, and the areas around it are very sacred to the native peoples of the area. Even in Cambria, there are sacred sites. The border must start where the Monterey Bay National Marine sanctuary border ends. 

Please include the area from Morro Bay North to Cambria. It is my opinion that it’s worth saving. The wind farm and all of the operations needed to maintain it can be located south near Santa Barbara area. It makes sense because naturally there are already structures and ports for oil wells, etc. in the area. There’s no need to bring that kind of industry this far north. I realize this can create a conflict between two government agencies, but the otters need a voice as do all of the other marine animals that live in this area peacefully.  Thank you for your time and reading my comment. I hope you do the right thing and include the areas originally proposed by the Chumash tribal council. Please respect  their sacred sites.

My name is Laura Chamberlin and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I live in Scottsdale, Arizona and to me, the ocean is vital to the sustainability of our planet, our human and animal life and our history.

Sample Descriptions of Relationship to the Ocean: I grew up on the East Coast, specifically Long Island, New York. My family spent many weekends enjoying the Atlantic Ocean, there and also in Cape Cod and Maine. My younger sister was a ""water baby"" and would demand that my father stop the car as soon as we crossed the Maine boarder so she could jump in the ocean. Humans and animals need safe places to enjoy the majesty of our ocean and sanctuaries need to be created to protect our shorelines. 

When I go to the coast, I  find myself awed by the enormous, seemingly endless vision of water. I feel balanced and serene in a way that doesn't happen anywhere else.
The ocean is personally important to me. We depend on the ocean for recreation, our spiritual well-being, our community connections, and our economic health.
I want to protect this stretch of ocean so my community can continue to connect with and benefit from a clean, safe, and healthy ocean.
The ocean is beautiful and mysterious. There is so much we’ve learned from it and much more to be learned. A sanctuary will be an important part of ocean research and education for present and future generations.
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes: Biggest Possible Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

Laura Chamberlin",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

My name is Mel Preston and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I have lived most of my life near the coast of California. The ocean is at the heart of our culture. As a child, I spent my summers boogie boarding and body surfing, and as an adult I go to the ocean often to walk with my dog and find some peace and quiet at the end of the day. As an ecologist, I have a strong connection to, and understanding of, how important the oceans are. I have lived and worked near coastal ecosystems for over a decade. I've been on boats to see blue whales, humpback whales, and albatrosses. I've spent many an hour tide pooling to see octopus or abalone, which are getting rarer and rarer. I've witnessed the collapse of fisheries and the crab season because the ocean's ecosystems are deeply imperiled and they need protection. I've witnessed the decline of shells, kelp and other natural material washed up on the beach, replaced by microplastics and trash. When a community bands together to protect what they love, and what gives them life, they should be supported. This is one of the richest coastal ecosystems in the world. If we don't follow the leadership of the Chumash people and stand up to protect and cherish this ecosystem now, it WILL be gone for the next generation. Many drastic changes have already happened, but with a strong commitment to the well being of this coastal ecosystem, we can encourage marine life to recover and even flourish. The Chumash National Marine Sanctuary needs our support.

I want to protect this stretch of ocean so my community can continue to connect with and benefit from a clean, safe, and healthy ocean.
 I ask that this sanctuary includes:

Biggest Possible Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension
Sanctuary Name: The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”
Tribal Collaborative Management: An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management.
Outreach & Education: Outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities

My name is Georgia Gayle Kretz and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I live in Brooklyn, NY and have always loved and wanted to preserve the beauty of the ocean. I know what it’s like to live near one of the most toxic rivers in the nation—the Gowanus Canal—and to see beaches despoiled with trash and industrial waste. On your coast, the ocean is not only enjoyed by all people, but particularly sacred to the Chumash, who deserve the right to help steward it and who will be able to contribute greatly to its conservation with their knowledge and care for it. Excluding them at this step is a terrible mistake that will only add to the list of broken promises made by the US government to Native nations. You have an opportunity to do the right thing for once, and the power I only wish I had to make things right. Please don’t squander it.

The Chumash usage of water per capita was far better than any other community in California. At the end I asked the question to the Chumash official: ""Did your Indigenous worldview have anything to do with such success?"" He replied: ""It was the main driver."" I just presented at the UN Biodiversity Summit on how Indigenous worldview is ""proven sustainable."" (See ProvenSustainable.org). The UN Biodiversity Report of 2019, the largest study ever done with 15,000 peer-reviewed papers, 450 researchers and 50 countries, revealed that where Indigenous worldview is operating such extinction rates are absent or severely reduced. (See my article in The Nation, ""The Media Missed A Crucial Message in the UN Biodiversity Report.""  80 percent of all biodiversity is on the 20% of the planet managed by Indigenous Peoples.  I raised money and helped direct efforts to create the first Category II Marine Sanctuary on the Costelgre coast of the Pacific in Jaliso Mexico, so I well know how important this issue is.

My name is Hannah Soto and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

When I go to the coast, I pray and make offerings to the land and to the water, the coast is my beloved relative.

The ocean is personally important to me. We depend on the ocean for recreation, our spiritual well-being, our community connections, and our economic health.
I want to protect this stretch of ocean so my community can continue to connect with and benefit from a clean, safe, and healthy ocean.
The ocean is beautiful and mysterious. There is so much we’ve learned from it and much more to be learned. A sanctuary will be an important part of ocean research and education for present and future generations.
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extensio, be named “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”, for an equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management, for outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities, to protect Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity, and finally, a prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.


Sincerely,

Hannah Soto",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

I am writing I am in support of the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. Please designate the sanctuary as it was originally proposed (Initial Boundary Alternative), as well as the Gaviota Extension (sub-alternative 5b), so that there is protection for the waters between Monterey Bay and Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuaries. This sanctuary offers the opportunity to elevate Indigenous perspectives and cultural values, honoring the history and culture of the Native Americans who have inhabited this region for more than 10,000 years. This sanctuary should protect the area from harmful oil and gas development and reduce water pollution in Sanctuary waters by preventing excess runoff of sediments, oils, pesticides, nutrients, and pathogens. The Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary should ensure that Offshore Wind operations and construction are completed through the guidelines of the new Sanctuary. These projects should be planned and authorized in a way that avoids and mitigates impacts to sensitive marine areas, species, and important cultural areas.

Improve the following to make it more professional and persuasive:  My name is Joe Connett and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.
I live in Ventura CA where I spent my career as a civilian supporting the United States Navy  and to me, protecting the ocean is vital for our future. I have spent 1000s of hours appreciating our coastal beauty on the shore and diving in our coastal waters. Please protect our ocean flora and fauna and by protecting them protect humanity.

Dear Sir or Madam 

My name is Joe Connett, and I am writing to urge you to swiftly designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary (CHNMS) with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension, covering approximately 7,600 square miles of ocean.

As a 35 year resident of Ventura, California, and a former civilian supporting the United States Navy, I have a deep appreciation for the importance of protecting our ocean and its resources. I have spent countless hours enjoying the coastal beauty of our region, both on the shore and in the water.

The CHNMS would provide a vital refuge for marine biodiversity and habitats, including kelp forests, rocky reefs, sandy beaches, and unique offshore geologic features. It would also help to address the global biodiversity crisis and accelerate nature-based solutions through inclusive partnerships and collaboration among federal, state, and local governments, and California Native American Tribes.

In addition to its environmental benefits, the CHNMS would also create new opportunities for scientific research, education, and economic development, including responsible recreation and tourism.

I urge you to support the swift designation of the CHNMS. It is a critical step towards protecting our ocean and ensuring a healthy and sustainable future for all.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

I live in Bradenton, Florida, on the Gulf Coast and the ocean represents life to me. I am so fortunate to live on the coast of Florida, having grown up on the east coast and now living on the west coast.  I do all that I can to help preserve the oceans. All life on this planet needs water, clean water. Humans have not done enough to preserve the oceans but I believe we can do much better.
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary include: 
•	The Biggest Possible Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with the Gaviota Coast Extension. This will help us do more to preserve our environment.
•	Sanctuary Name: The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”
•	Tribal Collaborative Management: An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management. Indigenous peoples know more than many non-indigenous peoples about how to preserve the land. They respect and live in it, as we all should.
•	Outreach & Education: Outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities
•	Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity. Biodiversity feeds and preserves our systems. We must acknowledge and support these systems. 
•	Ban Oil & Gas: A prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries. This is merely common sense. We need to be quickly moving away from fossil fuels. Creating this sanctuary assumes that we will not destroy it by drilling for gas and oil.  
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

My name is Kelly Hickey and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I work along the oceans shore and to me, the ocean are truly the lungs of the earth. 

When I go to the coast, I clean up the trash left or washed ashore by others. It is heartbreaking to see the turmoil human activity brings to the sea. 
The ocean is personally important to me. We depend on the ocean for recreation, our spiritual well-being, our community connections, and our economic health.
I want to protect this stretch of ocean so my community can continue to connect with and benefit from a clean, safe, and healthy ocean.
The ocean is beautiful and mysterious. There is so much we’ve learned from it and much more to be learned, especially our role in connecting with sea life and our interdependence. A sanctuary will be an important part of ocean research and education for present and future generations.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes educational placards that inform humans of the animal and vegetation within the ocean and the importance of a healthy, rubbish free water system. 

“Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”
Tribal Collaborative Management: An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management.
Outreach & Education: Outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities
Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity
Ban Oil & Gas: A prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

 

Together for clean oceans,

I strongly support the timely designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the original Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.  The Agency-preferred Alternative excludes the most significant portion of the original proposed Initial Alternative and the focus of much of the original discussions surrounding the plan from the beginning. The segment between Morro Bay and Cambria must be included to preserve the intergrity of the original concept as well as the regional protection and safeguards needed for success. The explanation that there is a need to prohibit the protection in case there is possible wind energy industrial development corrupts both this review process based upon speculative considerations and future review processes by predisposing the approval of a separate project and thereby prejudicing future decision making, contrary to the objectives of NEPA. Further, excluding this narrow stretch of coast will invite uses inconsistent with the adjacent preserves and protected areas that might not otherwise be considered. This cannot be overstated that this is an impact of the Agency-preferred Alternative that requires identification and mitigation. 

This section of coastline was and continues to be as significant if not most significant from a Native American cultural perspective as evidenced by the Northern Chumash Tribal Council championing this cause for many years at the local level. Their dedication and focused efforts are responsible for the impetus for the vital plan that now fails to accomplish the original objective.  Please honor the work of the NCTC and approve the original Initial Boundary Alternative.

I have lived on the central coast since 1982 and haved a strong reverence for our coastal resources. I have volunteered for the Marine Mammal Center in Morro Bay and seen how fragile this ecosystem is for all of the wildlife. Any proposal for offshore development must be sensitive to all of these resources most notably the Federally listed and protected sea otters concentrated around Morro Bay as well as nesting Peregrine falcons who utilize Morro Rock and forage in the surrounding area. 

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary and ask that this sanctuary include:

The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension.
Tribal Collaborative Management: An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management.
Outreach & Education: Outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities.
Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity.
Ban Oil & Gas: A prohibition on new oil and gas development within sanctuary boundaries.

My name is Andy and I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.
I live in Seattle, WA, but I grew up on the East Coast. Part of what drew me to the West Coast was the rugged beauty of the coast and the peace I find on the coast. It’s a place to go  hiking, kayaking, and spend time with friends and family, but most importantly it’s a time to reconnect with the land and ground myself in what’s important. Like so much of the US, the coast has been stewarded by the tribes since time immemorial and I think it’s important to honor their relationship to these places. This can be done both by bringing greater awareness to sacred places and by working with the tribes to make sure these places are there for future generations. 
This is why I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes the  the Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension, and that tribes are consulted in the naming, designation, and management of the sanctuary. This could include:
* Sanctuary Name: The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”
* Tribal Collaborative Management: An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management.
* Outreach & Education: Outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities
* Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity
* Ban Oil & Gas: A prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries

My name is Leah Agnor, I am native to California and lived in the Monterey Bay area for many years. There, I developed my love and appreciation for the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. It's important to me, and for future generations, that more areas are protected in the same way. To that end, I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I understand the need for alternative energy sources; but, I believe there are alternative ways for achieving those aims while simultaneously creating the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. Creating a sanctuary covering 7,600 square miles of ocean in the name and honour of the Chumash people; would be an incredible act of restorative justice that would bring us hope for the future. 

I ask that this sanctuary includes the largest possible boundary (i.e. the Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension). I ask that this sanctuary be called the “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary.” I ask that the Chumash tribe be included in the management of the the sanctuary. I ask that outreach, education and research programs are created that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities. I ask that the sanctuary includes the protection of Rodriguez Seamount, to protect biodiversity. I ask for the prohibition of new oil and gas development/exploration within sanctuary boundaries. And, if possible, I ask for the prohibition of commercial vessels and commercial fishing within the sanctuary.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary and I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

My name is Christina Dover and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I live in Newbury Park, California, and to me, the ocean is a source of calmness and beauty. I’ve spent almost every summer of my life along the California coast tidepooling, exploring, hiking, surfing, diving, and camping. The ocean is a huge part of what makes California incredible, and we need to protect it for its own sake, as well as for future generations. 

Therefore, I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes the largest possible boundary, equitable tribal management, outreach and education programs, protection of the Rodriguez Seamount, and a ban on new oil and gas production within the sanctuary. This sanctuary should be named the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary.

Dear Paul Michel,
My name is JoAnne Clarke and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.
I live in Merced, CA and to me, the ocean is a means of escape from the summer heat in the San Joaquin Valley.  My husband and I really enjoy kayaking on the coast.  I also enjoy hiking and tide pool exploration.  I want to protect this stretch of ocean so that my children and grandchildren can enjoy the benefits of clean, fresh, cool air and the opportunity to interact with the amazing wildlife and sealife that this area offers.  A sanctuary will be an important part of ocean research and education for present and future generations.
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary include the initial boundary alternative with Gaviota Coast extension, the largest boundary possible.  I would like to see the sanctuary called The Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary and that all tribes be included in collaborative management.  I would hope that traditional ecological knowledge and access for local underserved communities would be elevated by outreach, education and research programs.  To protect essential biodiversity, the Rodriguez Seamount must be protected and new oil and gas development prohibited within the sanctuary boundaries.
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.
Sincerely,
JoAnne Clarke

The National Marine Sanctuary system is a great way to preserve and protect our vital natural and cultural resources. We don't want these areas to be lost or destroyed. They are national treasures, irreplaceable places of learning, enjoyment and thriving communities of people, animals and plants. These places encourage bio-diversity and healthy ecosystems. And who knows what we will discover in these places. The CHNMS would be an outstanding addition. Honoring the Chumash, an important part of California history - and American history - by creating a new National Marine Sanctuary is an important step. Nurturing a thriving underwater ecosystem, especially in a changing climate, is critical. By preserving this space we are doing the right thing to help foster knowledge of our past which in turns makes for a better present and future. 
While it may be too small for some, it is too large for others. These concerns must be considered and when they are, the positives of creating this proposed new Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary is of benefit for all. When a Marine Sanctuary is created we know many species thrive in these protected areas. And many humans thrive too, being outside, experiencing and learning about the inhabitants and our history at that special location - even if some of us consider the sanctuary too small (or too big). This proposed Marine Sanctuary area is a beautiful and special location. I've had the privilege of being near and around this stunning stretch of California coastline. To know it is protected and preserved as the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary would make it a more beautiful place to be near. I look forward to visiting CHNMS soon!

My name is Beth Anderson and I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.
I live in Carpinteria CA and to me, the ocean is a fundamental system to the earth that is abused by human systems that use it as a limitless resource. The science shows us that the earths closed systems holds and recycles pollution that human activities put into the water, atmosphere, and land. I try to make life choices that have the least impact on harming the environment. I support positive legislation to regulate and protect the environment. I feel our capitalistic structure, and lack of regulations supports corporations, in rampant and huge scale, use of earth’s resources to develop products, many of them unnecessary, for capital gains, bloated through manipulations both commercial and political, while leaving resultant destruction and pollution. In the best-case scenario this leaves the tax payers and private efforts to clean up a small portion of the harms they levy en masse to the earth and life on earth.
Living on the coast, I realize I have a heightened awareness of nature and the environment because I see it every day: the creeks, estuaries, beach, ocean, flora and wildlife. I think this also yields more awareness of the impacts of environmental degradation as I've seen over decades: changes in the"" density of ocean wildlife I see in tidepools, poisons effecting ocean life as see neurological symptoms in seabird and sea mammals, as well as health concerns I have for food sources such as fish and what eventually cycles into our drinking water. 
The ocean is personally important to me and I know important to human life on earth. Although knowledge of that importance exists very few folks in human society have the daily awareness of our dependence on the ocean to ensure necessary consideration of actions and effect choices that support the health of the ocean.
I want to protect this stretch of ocean so my community can continue to connect with and benefit from a clean, safe, and healthy ocean.
A sanctuary will be an important part of ocean research and education for present and future generations. To grow the awareness and actions, to build on a model of improved stewardship necessary to effect change. 
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes: 
Biggest Possible Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension
Sanctuary Name: The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”
Tribal Collaborative Management: An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management.
Outreach & Education: Outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities

From other National Marine Sanctuaries we know fish grow larger and thrive. We know all animals and the plants who live in these communities are stronger and healthier and reproduce more.

The region is very remote with very little commercial and recreational pressure, so the opposition will then be muted since it is will not impact very many people. So this can be an easy ""win"" for marine conservation. To be fair, one could also argue that the region is so remote and relatively pristine, that the taxpayer burden for the administration and enforcement of the sanctuary is unnecessary.

One segment of the population that will be negatively impacted, ironically, is the research community that studies the flora and fauna of this specific region. Above I mentioned the fact that the proposed sanctuary includes a newly discovered adult white shark hotspot. How do I know that? My research team discovered it. I have lead a team of researchers that has been tracking the movements of the white sharks that visit this site. Our results are largely unpublished because the work is in progress, but the public has become aware of the site through some television documentaries we have released, the most recent being Counting Jaws on the National Geographic Channel. I have been studying white sharks for nearly 25 years, and I have had to obtain permits from the State of California, the Mexican government, and from one of the National Marine Sanctuaries off the California coast. I can say without hesitation that the extra level of permitting and restrictions that come with a Sanctuary permit are actually a hindrance to research. Many of the restrictions have no scientific data to justify them, and they sometimes unwittingly make the research more dangerous to both researchers and the species we are studying. 

If this Sanctuary becomes a reality, I encourage the new administering staff to work closely with researchers when considering research restrictions. We already must have our research reviewed and permitted by the State of California, and the work has proceeded smoothly with a track record of excellent results. There is no reason to impose additional, heavy handed restrictions that do nothing more than hinder important research. Already there is language drafted to prohibit the attraction of white sharks via chumming. Without the ability to chum for white sharks our research become too difficult to continue. I understand that regulators may want to prohibit the development of a cage diving industry, but that should not hinder research. In fact, the few studies that have been published regarding provisioning (chumming) and its impact on white sharks have shown that it does not have a negative impact on the sharks.

My name is Craig Markson.  I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I live in Santa Barbara, CA and to me, the ocean and how we treat it is one of the most important issues in my life.

My wife is a specialist in the behavior of cetaceans and I have been an advocate for protecting our oceans for almost 50 years, first as a Greenpeace volunteer in the 1970s.  The ocean and its inhabitants are of prime importance to us

As you already know, the ocean is severely affected by people and their behavior towards our environment.  One only has to walk along our beaches to see the untreated storm drain runoff into the ocean, notice all the trash getting into the ocean when doing Coastal Cleanup Days, learn about the huge island of man-made plastic and the amount of plastics found in practically all marine life, learn about the affect of ocean warming and the death of thousands of marine mammals from algae blooms and the bleaching of coral, the effect of naval testing on underwater communications of cetaceans, and the list goes on and on.  People have been terrible stewards of the world's oceans.

People are literally killing the oceans and the addition of floating wind turbines for the benefit of people and the detriment of birds and marine life will be just one more example of environmental decay.

The section of the ocean under review is vitally important to me and to the Chumash.  It is one of the most beautiful sections of California's coastline and how this proposal will affect the various seals, sea otters, dolphins and whales, and other marine life is totally unknown. A sanctuary will allow research and education and beauty for generations to come.      
  
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes:

    Biggest Possible Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension
    Sanctuary Name: The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”
    Tribal Collaborative Management: An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management.
    Outreach & Education: Outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities
    Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity
    Ban Oil & Gas: A prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

My name is Jon COURTWAY and I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Sanctuary, the sooner the better.  It should cover 7,600 square miles so as to protect the biodiversity and habitat therein. 

I live in  Sacramento CA and volunteer at the Cosumnes River Preserve that was once home to the Miwok people. Native CA Indians were targeted for extermination by our first Governor, Peter Burnnet in an address to the State legislature. Then CA passed a multi year bond greater than $1 million dollars to pay for that extermination.  

The designation of this sanctuary as “Chumash Heritage …” would help repay a great wrong. Tribal collaborative management would give them an an equitable voice over their traditional territory.

The ocean has much to teach us and future generations and this sanctuary is a huge step in that direction.

I ask that you respect the Northern Chumash Tribal Council requests regarding sanctuary boundary, the sanctuary name, tribal collaborative management, outreach and education, Rodriguez Seamount, offshore wind and water quality. Thank you for your work on this immediate need to preserve God's creation.

I think the proposal is a good idea, as I am always in favor of adding more protected waters and I support giving back to the indigenous people, however, I felt that the plan was not inclusive enough or consider other local fishing consumption. In the plan I saw it was listed that the Chumash rely on marine life for food, but don’t other indigenous groups also rely on the same environment? Maybe instead of being protected for the indigenous people, it becomes more inclusive and follows the same guidelines with the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary and gives indigenous people certain allowances. Also, what regulations are put into place to ensure that overconsumption of the MPA doesn’t occur?

My name is Caroline Duell, I am Founder and CEO of All Good, a Morro Bay based business,  and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

The wellness of the ocean, particularly around the Central Coast of California is central to our business.   I want to protect this stretch of ocean so my community can continue to connect with and benefit from a clean, safe, and healthy ocean.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes: 

Biggest Possible Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension
Sanctuary Name: The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”
Tribal Collaborative Management: An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management.
Outreach & Education: Outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities
Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity
Ban Oil & Gas: A prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

Dear Paul Michel:

My name is Audrey Taub and I am the founder of the San Luis Obispo Beaver Brigade.  We are a local organization in San Luis Obispo County dedicated to supporting our watersheds by supporting the beavers and their natural process of building dams, creating wetlands, and defining an entire ecosystem in their role as a keystone species.  We  enthusiastically support the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the inclusion of the coastal waters of Morro Bay and Cambria, which will form a contiguous sanctuary from the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary to the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary.

As noted in the Global assessment report on biodiversity and ecosystem services of the IPBES of 2019 (Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services), “the territories of Indigenous peoples and local communities contain 80% of the world’s remaining biodiversity and intersect about 40%1 of all terrestrial protected areas and ecologically intact landscapes”.  

It is well-known that the practices of indigenous people have, for thousands of years, focused on conservation and renewal of resources, even while the modern world has produced climate change and loss of biodiversity.   Traditional Ecological Knowledge is more and more being recognized as essential for incorporating into policy and natural resources management, especially in decisions relating to climate change.  The US Fish and Wildlife has produced a Fact Sheet to encourage crossover between TEK and Western Science, and there is a wealth of resources supporting the use of TEK.

One of the Key Messages from the 2019 IPBES Summary for Policymakers,

D5. Governance, including customary institutions and management systems and co-management regimes that involve indigenous peoples and local communities, can be an effective way to safeguard nature and its contributions to people by incorporating locally attuned management systems and indigenous and local knowledge.  The positive contributions of indigenous peoples and local communities to sustainability can be facilitated through national recognition of land tenure, access and resource rights in accordance with national legislation, the application of free, prior and informed consent, and improved collaboration, fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use, and co-management arrangements with local communities.
And
D7.  Sustaining and conserving fisheries and marine species and ecosystems can be achieved through a coordinated mix of interventions on land, in freshwater and in the oceans, including multi level coordination across stakeholders on the use of open oceans.  Specific actions could include, for example, ecosystem-based approaches to fisheries management, spatial planning, effective quotas, marine protected areas, protecting and managing key marine biodiversity areas, reducing run-off pollution into oceans and working closely with producers and consumers.

In addition to the full support by the San Luis Obispo County Beaver Brigade of the designation of  the entire Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary as it was originally proposed, including Morro Bay and Cambria,  we are in support of this proposal adhering to the suggestions outlined in the 2019 IPBES for including Indigenous peoples in the management of our oceans.  

From Volume 4, Issue 7, 23 July 2021, Pages 907-909, Indigenous peoples proven to sustain biodiversity and address climate change: Now it’s time to recognize and support this leadership author Steve Nitah writes, “Indigenous peoples sustain nature because we know we are a part of nature. We realize that trying to bend nature to our will would harm us as well as the animals, plants, and ecosystems we all depend on. Instead, Indigenous peoples have a reciprocal relationship with our territories. We know that if we take care of the land, the land will take care of us. And so, we honor our cultural responsibility to be careful stewards. When these relationships are respected and when the rights and responsibilities of Indigenous peoples are recognized and supported, the entire planet will benefit.”

We strongly urge NOAA to lead the preservation of an ecological and cultural treasure by approving the entire Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary including Morro Bay and Cambria with the greatest possible boundary,  maintaining the name of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary and utilizing tribal collaborative management..  

Sincerely,
Audrey Taub

This region hosts a complex system of ocean currents, where warmer waters from the south and colder waters from the north converge. The upwelling of colder, nutrient-rich waters from the deep brings nutrients to the surface for primary producers and phytoplankton - this supports an important and complex marine food web that is crucial to the health of our oceans. This area attracts marine species that migrate through five existing west coast national marine sanctuaries, including the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary (MBNMS). For over ten thousand years, the Chumash people have stewarded these waters, and the biodiverse life these waters support. In 2015 the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) accepted the Northern Chumash Tribal Council’s nomination for sanctuary status, and we encourage you to register your support for the largest, boundary option, as requested by the Tribal Council. Now is the time to stand with Indigenous leadership together.

Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary (CHNMS) would be the fifth national marine sanctuary off California and sixth off the continental west coast. This new designation would increase the protection of ecosystems from Mendocino County to southern Santa Barbara County. It would fulfill national marine sanctuary program protection goals, facilitate research, outreach, education, and maritime heritage objectives by protecting sacred Chumash cultural sites. NOAA proposes to collaborate with federally recognized Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Indians to access Indigenous knowledge and stewardship. The Northern Chumash Tribal Council supports tribal organizations and governments throughout the region having equal opportunities to collaborate - this also means tribes that are not currently Federally recognized by the United States government.  True equity would be equal opportunities, across the board, for all tribes.

This is the first tribally nominated sanctuary to have made it this close to designation, and the goal is to finalize the status designation by 2024.  There is still time to influence Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary’s boundaries and we need the public’s input. NOAA’s draft plan has an agency-preferred boundary alternative covering 5,600 square miles over 134 miles of coastline. That boundary alternative doesn’t connect to the southern boundary of MBNMS, as its nominators proposed. Instead, NOAA proposes a northern boundary at Hazard Canyon Reef, south of Morro Bay to accommodate electrical transmission cables from an offshore wind energy area outside the sanctuary. NOAA’s proposed changes imply that Morro Bay would not be part of the new sanctuary designation. The Chumash Tribe has voiced how important it is to include that area within the new sanctuary boundaries due to the significant cultural significance the area represents. We encourage you to support the Northern Chumash Tribal Council’s originally nominated boundary which protects 7,600 square miles over 156 miles of coastline, for continuous protection, including Morro Rock. Under sanctuary status, electric transmission cables can be permitted while other activities, such as offshore oil development and dumping, would be prohibited. Additionally, there are no new fishing regulations proposed in the designation. Can we make the commitment to truly listen to indigenous voices, to stand behind their requests, and give them the ownership they should have always had?  We know we can - let's make it happen together. The time to act is now!

We all have an opportunity to support an Indigenous-led Sanctuary, to help protect this region by shielding it from harm from new offshore oil drilling, terrestrial runoff from land, dumping of waste, seismic testing, and other negative impacts of climate change by supporting the proposed Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

Healthy marine ecosystems, especially kelp forests, help slow shoreline erosion and act as carbon sinks, which help slow and mitigate the problems cause by climate change. The original boundary protects more area against oil and gas development, while still allowing for offshore wind development and the passage of the necessary cables through the sanctuary. This will be both a step towards protecting the marine ecosystems and a push away from climate-destroying fossil fuels. 
I am also so excited to see collaboration with the Chumash and that indigenous knowledge will be incorporated into the management of this sanctuary.

It is fine to include a process for future installation of wind energy projects and the associated transmission lines as special use permits. It is important that the Sanctuary provides permanent protection specifically excluding possible future oil and gas energy projects and other harmful activities. That is the purpose of the Sanctuary designation, right? Please do not simply carve out a 2,000 sq mile ""exception"" section without clear protections in place. That's a terrible precedent 

This is an opportunity for NOAA to take a proactive approach in support of protecting the marine environment and to acknowledge our Chumash Indigenous Peoples' history, continued presence, and their societal needs and desires.

My name is Magnolia Turk and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I live in Santa Ynez, CA and to me, the ocean is one of our most precious resources and worthy of protection in every aspect.

Sample Descriptions of Relationship to the Ocean (Please restate so it’s specific to you):

I think that it is of critical importance that the Chumash tribe has a role in this ocean sanctuary, having cared for this stretch of coastline for more than 18,000 years..
I want to protect this stretch of ocean so my community can continue to connect with and benefit from a clean, safe, and healthy ocean.
The ocean is beautiful and mysterious. There is so much we’ve learned from it and much more to be learned. A sanctuary will be an important part of ocean research and education for present and future generations.
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes

Biggest Possible Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension - It is shocking that you are even considering reducing the scope of this ocean sanctuary to exclude Morrow Bay!
Sanctuary Name: The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”
Tribal Collaborative Management: An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management.
Outreach & Education: Outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities
Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity
Ban Oil & Gas: A prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

Dear NOAA,
Thank you for seeking, reviewing and carefully considering public input on the proposed Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary.
As a resident of Goleta, California; as someone who is very familiar with the area in question; and as a Lecturer who teaches ""Public Lands and Waters -- Law and Policy” in the Environmental Studies Department at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), I strongly support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative, plus the Gaviota Extension (sub-alternative 5b).
At stake is the protection of not only critically important public marine waters, but also of equally important public submerged lands. These lands and waters are significant for so many reasons, including biodiversity, climate change mitigation and adaptation, endangered species protection, tourism, and their sacredness and cultural significance to the Chumash peoples. 
To achieve 30x30, we need to protect as much of our nation’s lands and waters as warranted. The Initial Boundary Alternative, plus the Gaviota Extension is warranted. This full area contains an exceptional marine environment, irreplaceable cultural resources such as submerged historic Chumash villages, historic shipwrecks, and sensitive submerged lands, all of which deserve protection.
The Secretary of Commerce certainly has the authority to allow offshore wind transmission cables when establishing this National Marine Sanctuary and can specify how offshore wind transmission cables will be accommodated in the regulations governing the Initial Boundary Alternative plus the Gaviota Extension. There is no need to exclude these areas from the Sanctuary boundaries because doing so would (1) not be consistent with 30 x 30 and (2) would not provide these excluded areas with all of the other crucial protections that Sanctuary status confers under the National Marine Sanctuaries Act. It is very important to permanently protect the area from harmful activities like oil and gas development, seabed mining and dredging, and harmful polluting discharges to our waters; in addition to the benefits of being part of the Marine Protected Areas (MPA) system.
This is an exceptional opportunity for this Administration to (1) use all authority available to it to protect sacred Tribal (submerged) lands and waters, (2) to help advance 30 x 30 as fully as possible, (3) to get the full advantage of National Marine Sanctuary status and MPS status, while accommodating wind transmission cables; (4) to promote biodiversity, climate change adaptation and mitigation, and ecosystem services. 
Thank you for protecting our nation’s public submerged lands and waters off of California’s Central Coast with this National Marine Sanctuary – and specifically with the Initial Boundary Alternative, plus the Gaviota Extension (sub-alternative 5b).
With appreciation,
Deborah L. Williams, J.D.

I am requesting that you to make a contiguous sanctuary which connects the several existing sanctuaries by including the ocean waters between Point Buchon and Cambria as proposed in the Initial Boundary Alternative as originally proposed in 2021.
I am also a native Californian born in Santa Monica, so naturally have loved and cared for the Pacific coastline since I was a child. Born in 1946, I watched Santa Monica Bay become desolate from pollution, followed by decades of efforts to clean it up again. 
When I moved to Morro Bay in the late 1980’s I became active in municipal politics, elected to serve two 4-year terms as Councilmember in 1992 and in 1998. I was a constant advocate for marine protection during my 8 years in office.
Finally after all those years of working for a Marine Sanctuary off the Morro Bay coast, we have come to the brink of success!
As an indigenous grandfather my greatest obligation is to protect a viable world in which my progeny can thrive. The threat of human-induced climate change is real, and the situation is dire! Moving away from fossil fuels to produce energy is essential to reverse this existential challenge, so the efforts being made by California and the Federal Government to create alternative energy sources such as the off-shore wind project is essential. That effort and the protection of the ocean is not in conflict, but must be achieved through genuine, creative cooperation, as has been done in other sanctuaries. The conduit cable routes should be grandfathered in since the existence of the already-leased wind farm sites naturally assume the necessity of cables to the on-shore electric grid. Once in place, they would offer no significant detriment to marine life or commerce. 
Therefore I am writing to encourage you to include Morro Bay in the proposed new Sanctuary.

My name is Dr. Ross Quinn. I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary as originally proposed, and with Gaviota Coast Extension.  This is necessary to protect ourselves, and the biodiversity and health of our oceans.
I now live in Victorville, California, but I grew up in the beach city of Ventura.  To me, the ocean is a deep part of my being.  I grew up body surfing its waves, walking is beaches, and fishing its waters, both from the Ventura Pier, and from charter boats going out to the Channel Islands.  Santa Cruz and Anacapa Islands were the ocean’s background every day, especially at sunset. This Chumash coast lives within me, even while I live inland, in the desert. The Pacific Ocean seems now more precious to me in its absence, than it was when I lived by it.
Importantly, I have personally seen the improvement of the ocean’s and shore’s health after the establishment of the Southern Chumash Marine Sanctuary, the establishment of the Channel Islands National Park, and the purchase of Santa Cruz by the Nature Conservancy.  The ocean became cleaner.  Fish catches increased. Discharges from land into the Pacific decreased.  People became able to visit the islands, and to get to know them. And the Chumash museum opened in Ventura, financed by their inland casino, for better or worse.  For the best, however, it has been a focal point for dissemination of the Chumash knowledge and culture, and their millenniums-long conservancy of these precious lands and waters. 
So again, I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary in central California. I urge that the Sanctuary be established to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures… As we have benifitted in Southern California from the Southern Chumash Marine Sanctuary.
Excluding both the Chumash people from its management, and excluding the full extent of the Sanctuary, because it is incompatible with off-shore electricity generation, is just terrible policy.  I think there are still way too many unknowns re the multiple impacts that this power generation could wreak on our Pacific Ocean’s eco-system. And for sea creatures, finding suitable areas for feeding, breeding, and migration will undoubtedly become MUCH more difficult, and these areas will become much more limited in their extent, given the severe climate changes we are experiencing.  In my opinion, we urgently need to greatly increase roof-top solar generation and battery systems on all existing buildings on land, and NOT risk our ocean.  Worse is the great risk of eco system fragmentation:  Whales and fish do not respect mankind’s artificial boundaries. Even if 90% of their territory is protected, if their migration paths cross the 10% where they are not protected, they can still be threatened, and become critically endangered, or worse, go extinct. 
For all these reasons, I feel it imperative that that we approve the full extent of the Chumash Heritage Marine Sanctuary as originally proposed, and that the Chumash Tribe name and role in the Sanctuary’s management be fully adopted and protected.  It is vital that we immediately and permanently ban oil and gas drilling here, and any ocean floor mining.  And we must greatly increase educational outreach, so that the population at large can better understand the need to do all this, and how we will all benefit from taking these critically needed actions.

My name is Kat Gelsey and I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, INCLUDING Morro Bay.

Morro Bay has historically been decimated by poor resource management practices, which led to the decimation of key species such as abalone and sea otters. 

I live in Lake County, California, around 100 miles from the Mendocino Coastline.

Morro Bay has historically been destroyed by extractive, unsustainable forms of natural resource management. Offshore wind projects proposed there are not sustainable if they impede protection for Morro Bay's endangered and unique wildlife. In addition to being home for some of the last remaining sea otters in the country, Morro Bay is also a refuge for hundreds of marine species at risk of extinction from decades of mismanagement. Don't let the same mistake be made again in Morro Bay. Include it in the Chumash National Marine Sanctuary.

Sincerely,
Kat

As a lifelong resident of California and a current graduate student studying Environmental Policy and Management with a focus in Natural Resources Management, I was excited to learn of the Proposed Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary (CHNMS) and its trajectory to become the first National Marine Sanctuary that resulted from direct involvement with Indigenous peoples. I applaud the Office of National Marine Sanctuaries (ONMS) and National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for moving forward with this designation and providing opportunities for the Central Coast’s First Peoples, specifically the famously seafaring Chumash, to collaborate on management of this culturally significant area. 
I was dismayed, however, at the amendment to the Initial Boundary Proposal (IBP) and exclusion of the portion between Morro Bay and Cambria. While I recognize the need for developing offshore wind power, it is my understanding that the area excluded in the Agency-Preferred Alternative (APA) could also potentially be targeted for seabed mining and oil and gas developments.
It is also my understanding that there are mechanisms in place to both designate this area a Sanctuary and allow for some offshore wind development, while prohibiting more harmful activities associated with seabed mining ad fossil fuel developments specifically, both of which pose a real threat to our already-strained ocean ecosystems. As NOAA notes on their National Marine Sanctuaries website page concerning wind power development in the CHNMS, “given that certain concentrations of this infrastructure may not be compatible with a national marine sanctuary depending on the number of cables and disturbance that could occur”. I have italicized the key parts of that statement, which further obfuscate the purpose of eliminating this region from the APA, as limited wind development or development stratified through a larger area of the Sanctuary could still meet Sanctuary standards as defined by NOAA and the ONMS and avoid large impacts to the environment. The reduction of the nearly 2,000 square miles of ocean protection and 18 miles of coastline also diminishes the congruence with President Biden’s America the Beautiful Initiative’s goal of conserving and restoring 30% of our land and waters and would necessitate new designations to achieve the same amount of conservation as the IBP, which would be a costly and time-intensive process. 
As a student of Natural Resources Management, I find the APA to greatly diminish the overall potential positive impact of the CHNMS for the reasons noted above and I stand with the Surfrider Foundation and the Chumash peoples in calling for the IBP to serve as the blueprint for the Sanctuary’s boundaries, and considering keeping the addition of coastline next to Gaviota found in the APA.

My name is Amanda Christophe. I am a San Luis Obispo resident and an environmental professional. I am writing to express overwhelming support for the Chumash National Marine Sanctuary. As the first tribally-nominated sanctuary, I believe that it is important that local Tribes play a central and collaborative role in the decision-making, implementation, and management / governing bodies of this Sanctuary. For this reason, I am advocating that the Proposed Sanctuary incorporate the boundaries that were proposed by the Chumash Tribe, including the Gaviota Coast Extension. This stretch of ocean is critical to ocean wildlife, and if protected would provide connecting pathways to Monterey Bay. If not protected, it would be subject to offshore wind, oil, and gas, which would have a negative impact on wildlife. While I understand that offshore wind is an important endeavor, the larger boundary still allows for this. The Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary is a wonderful opportunity to further protect our oceans, build relationships with Tribes, and educate communities on the importance of oceanic ecosystems!

I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

The ocean is absolutely essential for the health of this planet and all creatures living here.
    It is personally important to me. 
We depend on the ocean for recreation, our spiritual well-being, our community connections, and our economic health.
    I want to protect this stretch of ocean so all communities can continue to connect with and benefit from a clean, safe, and healthy planet.
The ocean is beautiful and mysterious. There is so much we’ve learned from it and much more to be learned. A sanctuary will be an important part of ocean 
    research and education for present and future generations.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes at minimum the following points: 

    - Biggest Possible Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension;

    - Sanctuary Name: The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”;

    - Tribal Collaborative Management: An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management;

    - Outreach & Education: Outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local
               under-served communities;

    - Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity; and

    - Ban Oil & Gas: A prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

My name is Mari Beckman-Lau and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

It is so important to preserve our oceans and to continue and expand research and conservation efforts to protect its ecosystems.  According to the World Wildlife Fund, ""Although they comprise less than 5% of the world population, Indigenous peoples protect 80% of the Earth's biodiversity in the forests, deserts, grasslands, and marine environments in which they have lived for centuries.""  Therefore in my opinion, the more land stewardship we can put back in the hands of Indigenous tribes and nations, the better for the planet and everyone who lives on it.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary and hope that it includes the Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension; the name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”; an equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management, outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities; and a prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries

Thank you for all the important work you are doing.

    Please designate the sanctuary using the initial boundaries proposed (Initial Boundary Alternative), plus the Gaviota Extension (sub-alternative 5b) in order to provide contiguous protection between Monterey Bay and Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuaries.
    This area contains a rich, diverse marine environment, cultural resources such as submerged historic Chumash villages, and shipwrecks, all of which are deserving of protection.
    Offshore wind transmission cables can be accommodated through a special use permit at a later date, but in the meantime, we must permanently protect the area from harmful activities like oil and gas development, seabed mining and dredging, and harmful polluting discharges to our waters.
    Thank you for protecting our Central Coast with this National Marine Sanctuary.

The ocean is a pristine part of our culture and an ecosystem full of wonder that we should protect and treasure for the sake of animals, plants, and humans.

When I go to the coast, I throw the football with friends, boogie board, and take in the peaceful scenery full of calm sunsets, vibrant waves, and unique wildlife. Furthermore, the ocean is personally important to me. We depend on the ocean for recreation, our spiritual well-being, our community connections, and our economic health. Therefore, I want to protect this stretch of ocean so my community can continue to connect with and benefit from a clean, safe, and healthy ocean.

The ocean is beautiful and mysterious. There is so much we’ve learned from it and much more to be learned. A sanctuary will be an important part of ocean research and education for present and future generations.

I am a scientist and frequent visitor to the central coast of California.  I am writing to ask you to protect this area by designating this area as a marine sanctuary.  Specifically, I ask that you swiftly finalize the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean.  This area is one of the most profoundly beautiful and biologically diverse regions in the world. 
The Marine Sanctuary would contribute to studies of the effects of climate change on marine environments, while providing as much protection as possible to the area's biodiverse species.  Furthermore, the incorporation of Tribal ecological knowledge of the Indigenous Chumash people will help to build resilience along the Pacific coast.
As an adult, I have been thrilled to revisit the Pacific Coast of my childhood, especially the beaches off San Luis Obispo and northern Santa Barbara Counties.  My deep love of this area moves me to advocate for strong protections.  These waters create an incredibly productive feeding ground that attracts a menagerie of marine wildlife. The vulnerable species living and migrating within this critical habitat deserve our protection from development and exploitation. I remind you that areas within the Central Coast waters, which teemed with native marine wildlife decades ago, have shown an alarming decline in species and populations.
Furthermore, the Central Coast of the Pacific Coast benefits families, visitors, and communities.  I was blessed as a youngster, because my family spent leisure time along the central coast of California.  When I interacted with this environment, it benefited me in the following ways:
I learned about marine wildlife, which prompted me to explore science.
I developed physical strength as a paddler in the Pacific Ocean currents.
I appreciated the beauty of the Pacific Ocean, which prompted me to write poetry and essays about it, which grew my literary creativity.
It is urgent to protect this treasured coastline and waters by finalizing the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary and fulfilling the following: 
Provide effective protections by creating the largest boundary possible: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension.
Honor the Leaders and Members of the Northern Chumash Tribal Council: Adopt the name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”.
Fully adopt Tribal collaborative management: Utilize a fair system that will include all Tribes in Collaborative Management.
Promote effective outreach, education, and research programs: Focus on programs that will incorporate Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and provide access for local underserved communities.
Ensure full protection of the Rodriguez Seamount: Its biodiversity is essential to the regional ecosystem.
Effectively prohibit all oil & gas development within sanctuary boundaries.
Please quickly designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary for the benefit of marine wildlife, people, and the climate.",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/NOAA-NOS-2021-0080-2071/attachment_1.docx","pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

I live in San Luis Obispo, CA and to me, the ocean is a reminder of how small we really are. It is beauty and power and mystery, a place of joy and for me it holds many fond memories. I grew up by the sea in southern California, and cannot imagine not living near the ocean. The central coast shores have grown my love for the ocean even more!! 
When I go to the coast, I go on walks, runs, swims. I occasionally bring a surfboard and will paddle out at sunset. There is no peace like the peace of lying on a board past the surf, the orange sun kissing the endless blue horizon.

They could also implement a rule of no traveling or anchoring within a certain distance (1 mile) of land. With offshore winds this would be extremely dangerous to all recreational boaters.

When my husband (Colby Crotzer) and I moved to Morro Bay in 1998, we became active in our community politics. We decided that one of the most important ways we could help to provide our grandchildren with the same quality of life we have enjoyed here would be to work to get our coastline included as part of a National Marine Sanctuary on the West Coast.  In the late 1990s and early 2000s, our goal at that time was to try to get a new sanctuary or to add our central coastline to the already existing Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. We spent years on this project.  I have letters I wrote to NOAA in 2006 along with comments I made at various public meetings, etc. all in favor of being included in this expansion.  Most of our community had not even realized that the oceans along our coast were still susceptible to having oil wells off of our coast or by having the Central Valley’s agricultural waste salts and pollutants such as selenium dumped here.  Besides affecting the quality of ocean waters, since Morro Bay is a tourist town, this would be detrimental to attract the visitors who the city needs to sustain our tourist economy. Who would want to come here only] to see oil wells and a coastline depleted of sea life?
For years, there has been a discussion of what to do with contaminated wastewater produced by San Joaquin Valley agriculture.  Morro Bay has long been considered one of the choice locations for this dumping.  Selenium is highly toxic to fish and wildlife and has been implicated in both fishery declines and the deaths of thousands of shorebirds and waterfowl (San Francisco Chronicle, Nov 1, 2005 article by Glen Martin).  Sierra Club Santa Lucia Chapter Director Andrew Christie summed up our perspective perfectly in an article in New Times SLO on September 21, 2023.  He quotes State Sen. John Laird (D-Santa Cruz):  ""Whatever the pathway, I implore NOAA to find a creative solution to ensure the protection of an unfragmented stretch of the Pacific Ocean between the Monterey Bay and Channel Island sanctuaries, while also enabling the successful implementation of offshore wind energy."" 
Director Christie continues: 
            ""There's something missing in NOAA's agency-preferred alternative version of the map that was submitted with the sanctuary nomination. The initial boundary alternative would fill the gap between Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary and Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary and would protect 7,573 square miles of ocean. But the agency's preferred boundary includes a cut-out of San Luis Obispo County waters of approximately 750 square miles between Cambria and Montaña de Oro and reduces the total boundary by nearly 2,000 square miles.
            The problem: The shipping and undersea cables serving the future offshore wind farm will pass through that area, and NOAA does not want to regulate that industrial development in a national marine sanctuary. And the Salinan tribe also includes that coastal area as part of its historic lands and have let it be known they would not appreciate a marine sanctuary there dedicated to Native American cultural heritage that omits their name.
            The solution: NOAA's concern is basically the timing—i.e., if the area is designated as a marine sanctuary and then the cable and shipping infrastructure are allowed, that sets a precedent. But if the cables are laid and then the marine sanctuary is declared, no problem. National marine sanctuaries include any number of preexisting features that would not have been allowed if they were proposed to be constructed after the marine sanctuary was created. (Case in point: The proposed Gaviota Coast extension for the Chumash sanctuary includes the existing oil pipelines from the offshore rigs to the onshore processing plant.) Wind energy companies must submit maps of their cable routes for federal certification. Once the routes are certified, the cables become a preexisting fait accompli, and the marine sanctuary could then include the Point Buchon to Cambria region, which could also be designated as a special treatment area of the sanctuary, with a name acceptable to the Salinans.""
This sums up my perspective completely and we hope that you will vote to INCLUDE Morro Bay, as we have been working to do for decades.

As a former surfer, active Surfrider SLO member, and recently certified and exploring SCUBA diver, I strongly urge NOAA to address the following concerns in regard to the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary: 

1. Adopt strong regulation and management plans to ensure sufficient protections for the region’s sensitive habitats, cultural resources, and sustainable Human Resources. I have seen what other marine sanctuaries locally (e.g. Monterey and Channel Islands) have done to help repopulate and conserve precious ecosystems that are not only essential to oceanic survival but also to human survival. Without a thriving ocean, we as humans cannot survive which has been proven time and time again. The power and protection that comes with the establishment of marine sanctuaries have done just that; provided power and protection to a critical resource to human and animal survival alike. 

2. Include the full geographic extent reflected in the Initial Boundary Alternative, in addition to the Gaviota Coast Extension (5B). When it was discovered that the Initial Boundary Alternative did not include my home county from Point Buchón up to Cambria where the edge of the Monterey Marine Sanctuary begins, I was intially worried. Worried for the thriving kelp beds, the otters and urchins who live there. Worried for the pristine untouched tide pools and open natural areas surrounding it to be negatively impacted and/or destroyed by man made operations. Worried for my favorite local surf spot being compromised due to pipes, and my favorite local dog beach to be shut down to my two pups who love to run freely on the coastline like so many of us. Worried for our infamous elephant seals who pup near Hearst Castle annually. I worry about not just the marine life, but also the continuation and production of excess carbon that is destroying our planet and removing the only protection we have against excess carbon; the ocean and natural elements found within it that help absorb carbon safely and effectively. 

3. In the enabling regulations, include special permits for the transmission cables needed for anticipated offshore wind project development and operations in the Morro Bay Wind Energy Area. There is no shortage of concern regarding renewable energy, but the movement of the energy from the offshore wind needs to actually be moved to land for human use so we can decrease the use of gas and oil that ultimately will damage and create more chemical destruction. This is one small way to address the energy crisis and without this approval, more and more oil will be extracted and exploited that could have been avoided. 

This marine sanctuary proposal (and extension 5B) has so many projected benefits from ecological safety, conservation, climate change impacts, economic gains from increased tourism economies, and support to the already limited resources available to our local indigenous peoples. Please consider our concerns in the development in this plan for the benefit of so many human and non-human animal alike. 

Thank you for your time,

I doubt it, which means adding to our national debt.

In fact, the presence of SpaceX is a major conflict. Rockets are not currently allowed to fly over the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary, so how can we create a new sanctuary on the doorstep of such a major rocket launch facility? Since the proposed sanctuary will not be bringing any new resource management to the region, it will simply be an impediment to scientists that are already working there, on land and in the ocean.

Dear Paul Michel,

My name is dogan ozkan and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I live in fairbanks, alaska and to me, the ocean is important

Sample Descriptions of Relationship to the Ocean

When I go to the coast, I watch the wildlife and swim.

The ocean is personally important to me. We depend on the ocean for recreation, our spiritual well-being, our community connections, and our economic health.

I want to protect this stretch of ocean so my community can continue to connect with and benefit from a clean, safe, and healthy ocean.
The ocean is beautiful and mysterious. There is so much we’ve learned from it and much more to be learned. A sanctuary will be an important part of ocean research and education for present and future generations.
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes: 

Biggest Possible Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension
Sanctuary Name: The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”
Tribal Collaborative Management: An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management.
Outreach & Education: Outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities
Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity
Ban Oil & Gas: A prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

In response to the draft designation documents, I support the following actions per category:

Sanctuary Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension Sanctuary

Name: The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”

Tribal Collaborative Management: An inclusive approach to all Tribes in Collaborative Management & a NOAA Tribal Liaison.

Outreach and Education: Outreach, education and research programs that elevate Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities

Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount

Offshore Wind: Thoughtful planning of adjacent Offshore Wind farms to protect ocean life

Water Quality: A prohibition on new oil & gas development within sanctuary boundaries

It is especially important for the CHNMS to cover the largest area possible, specifically connecting the Monterey Bay and Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuaries to create a safe corridor for species passage throughout the entire stretch of coastline from Rocky Point to the Channel Islands. This larger designation is imperative to fully protect many of the region's species, including eelgrass beds, Southern sea otters, and an abundance of intertidal species. It has been well-documented that MPAs are more successful when they are connected to one another through MPA networks, allowing migratory species more protection. I think that the CHNMS is no exception, and we have a very special opportunity to connect three very important marine sanctuaries and thus supercharge the benefits of each of them.

It is also very important that there is tribal collaborative management, as this sanctuary is an opportunity to advance environmental justice efforts, have overdue indigenous representation in the management of our natural environments, and learn and be guided by those who have successfully managed and regenerated these ecosystems for millennia. Traditional Ecological Knowledge should be elevated through outreach and education programs, teaching the importance of ocean stewardship, Chumash tribal history, and the ways in which we can move forward as a community to heal these sacred waters. 

This sanctuary is an incredible opportunity to champion, learn from, and honor the Northern Chumash who have stewarded these lands and waters since time immemorial. It is a crucial step in truly respecting and honoring the sacred sites of the Chumash and showing appreciation for their millennia of stewardship. While there is direct ecological benefit for tribal co-management of this sanctuary, I think it is important to also highlight the stand-alone importance of protecting this area for the sake of the Chumash peoples, who have strong cultural ties to this area, ancestors who have lived and died here, and a deep reverence for their original homeland. We owe it to the Chumash to protect this stretch of sea while we still can. I believe this sanctuary can serve as a guiding light forward for other indigenous communities around the world to reclaim their rightful positions as stewards of their lands and waters, and this is a massive step towards a world in which we live more harmoniously with both nature and each other.

Too often have we seen abandoned Wind projects left to become rust and rubble in sensitive areas.  I still advocate that a WIND project should only be considered on land and not ocean in attempt to preserve the ocean.
Include the full geographic extent reflected in the Initial Boundary Alternative, as well as the Gaviota Coast Extension (5B).
In the enabling regulations, allow for personal sea crafts usage for Surfing , Snorkel/dive in the Sanctuary for recreation and personal usage, and include special permits for the Wind project to be relocated from Ocean site to a land site of their choice.

This larger area is necessary to protect the migratory routes of whales, dolphins, sea lions, sharks and numerous bird species, not to mention all the tiny organisms below the surface. Protection of the rich biodiversity of this area is crucial for the survival of these species that are already dealing with the effects of: a warming and acidifying ocean due to climate change, a noisy ocean caused by shipping traffic, and the decline in populations due to overfishing.

The Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary is vital to protecting California’s Central  coastline, however the proposed boundaries for the site drafted by NOAA deny the Chumash and surrounding communities the ability to provide meaningful input where the development of off-shore wind is concerned. Renewable energy sources are essential to providing power to the coastline and relieve Californians’ dependence on harmful fossil fuels, but such development must remain under the custodial eye of the Chumash peoples who are the original caretakers of this land.

According to Paul Michel the NOAA has completed no environmental analysis on the impacts that offshore wind will have on the region. Under the protection of the CHNMS, offshore wind farming will still be possible, and can be effectively planned and implemented in ways which protect the coastal ecology, the safety and preservation of human, animal, and plant life on and offshore. 

Through this reasoning I hope that NOAA will be compelled to honor the boundaries of the site created and proposed by the Chumash Northern Council.

Sincerely, 
Jasmine Jackson

I am writing in support of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. 
Growing up on the Central Coast, the Chumash were the only Native Americans I was ever provided context for. I recall molding model Chumash villages from clay in 3rd grade, and visiting a model of their village around that same time. 
Now I work for a Urban Indian Health Organization in the Central Valley. We serve many populations and tribes, including Chumash who have relocated to the area. 
As any Central Coast born person would attest to, the beauty and diversity of the coastline is unlike any others in the world. Furthermore, the Chumash were the original stewards of this land, which has been completely stolen from them, sold, and tourist-ified. To provide sanctuary to this section of California would give honor to the beliefs of the descendents of the original people. Furthermore, biologically the opportunity to reduce human impact on the diverse population of species along the coast would be beyond crucial for serving generations to come.

In the news this morning I read where 100's porpoises were found dead because of the warming waters. In the 72 years I have lived in this state I have witnessed terrible pollution of the waters, over-fishing, unregulated use of large sea nets and gillnets indiscriminately drowning sea turtles, porpoises and other precious sea life, over-development and erosion of our beaches and the disappearance of so many once plentiful species.

Dear Paul Michel,

My name is Carolyn Krueger and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.
I live in Morro Bay, CA, I believe the ocean and all of its miraculous, diverse inhabitants and dependents deserve our respect, stewardship, and protection.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes:
* The Biggest Possible Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension
* Sanctuary Name: The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”
* Tribal Collaborative Management: An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management.
* Outreach & Education: Outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities
* Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity
* Ban Oil, Gas, and Wind Farms: A prohibition on new Oil, Gas, and Wind Farm development within sanctuary boundaries

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

Hi,

I’m a longtime resident of the Central Coast from my College days in the 80’s to my present stint from 1997 to the present.

A protected marine sanctuary is critical to the preservation of the earth and all its creatures including humans.

I fully support a sanctuary that covers the largest continuous expanse including Morro Bay, Cambria, Cayucus etc. 

If you are ignorant of how critical it is to save our waters and lands for future generations of the ecosystem then at least consider it for the preservation and enjoyment of current inhabitants.

I also feel strongly that the name if not named something more inclusive like the combination of both Chumash and Salinian names for the ocean, or Central Coast Marine Sanctuary that it should be called The Chumash Salinian Marine Sanctuary as this land was indigenous to both tribes.

Thank you,
Morgan Bowen

My name is Amelia Agranovich, I am a Masters student from Maryland and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I first heard about this Marine Sanctuary Proposal through Mission Blue - an organization founded by the world renowned marine biologist, Sylvia Earle. I believe that it is vital we protect our oceans, and maintain indigenous rights. The ocean is perhaps the greatest reason that we are not feeling even more extreme effects of climate change, and the biodiversity found within is astounding. It is crucial to protect as much of the ocean as we can, as this is how we protect ourselves for generations to come, and the wildlife within deserves to have spaces free from exploitation. Therefore, I am a big supporter of the proposed Marine Sanctuary. 





I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary has the largest possible boundary -  The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension. I ask that it is named the “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”. I ask that it is managed equitably with indigenous people through Tribal Collective Management. I ask that outreach, education and research programs are created that elevate Traditional Ecological Knowledge alongside Western-based Science. I ask that local underserved communities can have access to the Sanctuary. I request also that the Rodriguez Seamount is strictly protected. My final request is that no future exploration for oil and gas is allowed within the sanctuary boundaries, and that if there is any current exploration/extraction - it is prohibited with the sanctuary's creation. 

Sincerely,
Amelia Agranovich",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

Dear Paul Michel,

My name is Robin Generaux and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the IniBoundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I live in Las Vegas, Nevada, and to me, the ocean is precious to me. I grew up in Long Beach, CA and I have always considered it my real home.

Sample Descriptions of Relationship to the Ocean (Please restate so it’s specific to you):

When I go to the coast, I love to walk on the beautiful beach and my heart is filled with sadness that it might be destroyed.
The ocean is personally important to me. I remember body surfing and playing at the beach with my mom and dad. We depended on the ocean for our recreation. My parents were young and had little money so the beach was always the best place to spend our days.
I want to protect this stretch of ocean so my community can continue to connect with and benefit from a clean, safe, and healthy ocean.
The ocean is beautiful and mysterious. There is so much we’ve learned from it and much more to be learned. A sanctuary will be an important part of ocean research and education for present and future generations.
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary include a continuation of the efforts to protect sacred sites. Only with continued effort will the sanctuary be safe from developers.

Biggest Possible Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension
Sanctuary Name: The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”
Tribal Collaborative Management: An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management.
Outreach & Education: Outreach, education, and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities
Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity
Ban Oil & Gas: A prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

I live in Paso Robles, CA and have lived in northern San Luis Obispo for my whole life.  The ocean has always been just a 20-minute drive away and a place I go for peace and contemplation.  A place I’ve taken my children, my grand-children and now my great-granddaughter.  What I have always taught them is that the ocean is life and must be protected! 

A clean and healthy ocean is vital to the well-being of every living thing on this planet.  We know that the areas off of the California coast here have been over fished, we know there is damage that must be mitigated.  The marine sanctuary will do much to repair what has been damaged to protect it from further damage and destruction.

I live in Ventura, California and to me, the ocean is a large part of what sustains human life in our region and across the world. Its biodiversity offers endless exploration and opportunities to improve our world. The nature is unlike nothing else and deserves to be protected. 

When I go to the coast, I walk along the shore, swim in the ocean, explore the wildlife via boat, bird watch, reflect on my part in humanity, feel grateful to be alive, enjoy the company of others, and bask in the fresh ocean air and sunshine.
The ocean is personally important to me. We depend on the ocean for recreation, our spiritual well-being, our community connections, and our economic health.

I have lived in what is now called Shell Beach since 1993 and am grateful every day to the original and current caretakers of this land and ocean, the Northern Chumash, for their stewardship which has preserved the beauty and well being of the place I call home. I am an ally and supporter in favor of designating the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary based on the Initial Boundary Alternative including Morro Bay as proposed in the sanctuary nomination combined with the Gaviota Coast Extension (Sub Alternative 5b). 

Since I met Violet Sage Walker in 2015, I have been a supporter of the proposed sanctuary. She has patiently cultivated my learning about the relationships we have with the land and water and in particular the profound spiritual, cultural, and practical ties that bind the Chumash and the Central Coast. I am very grateful to see the significant progress the designation has made to date. However, the boundary excluding Morro Bay being put forth by NOAA at this time would gravely diminish its impact. By NOAA’s own report, the, “initial boundary alternative would have the greatest number and magnitude of significant beneficial impacts” of all the possible options. None of the other boundary options - including the one preferred by NOAA - would have the same level of significant beneficial impacts. 

These significant impacts are 

Cultural - Morro Bay to the north and Point Sal to the south are critical elements of Chumash and other Indigenous peoples’ cultural beliefs, rituals, and practices. Removing Morro Bay from this designation severely undermines the goal of the original nomination by leaving Morro Bay exposed to potential further damage. It was just in the last century that developers deemed it appropriate to blast significant portions of Morro Rock, desecrating a sacred space to be used as material for road beds, buildings, and breakwaters. Keeping it within the sanctuary boundary protects it from further destruction.


The impacts are logistical - creating a contiguous line of marine sanctuaries from Point Arena to the Gaviota Coast. CHNMS Connects the Monterey Bay and Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuaries - mitigating the loss of effectiveness seen at the borders of sanctuaries.

The impacts are ecological - Connecting the sanctuaries along the coast mitigates what a study in the journal, Nature Ecology & Evolution.calls the “edge effect” the result of Human impacts on the ocean ecosystem close to the edges of marine protected areas that causes damage within the protected area. 

Finally, including Morro Bay has significant economic impacts
Since the sanctuary supports sustainable use of the oceans to encourage further economic development in commercial and recreational pursuits for the community. In regards to the Wind Energy development underway, Including Morro Bay will ensure a contiguous buffer of ocean protection, while directing Offshore Wind development to more suitable areas further offshore where wind energy is optimal and ecological and cultural impacts can be reduced. The sanctuary will also allow for consistent monitoring and research needed to understand the long term impacts of Offshore Wind. 

Any Offshore Wind transmission cables proposed for this area as part of future offshore wind development should require permits from the National Marine Sanctuary Program to ensure that they are planned and sited to reduce and mitigate impacts to the ocean.
Including Morro Bay in the designation invites meaningful collaboration with tribal leadership and the broader community; conservation and marine protection from the in-progress renewable energy efforts; and supports the original intent and purpose for this proposal.

Please approve the boundaries as originally proposed for the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary in order to protect ecologically and culturally critical areas of the Central Coast in advance of planned future development of Offshore Wind farms in the region. While Offshore Wind may prove an important source of renewable energy, it will also result in a range of environmental impacts to ocean habitat, wildlife, and water quality. Through careful planning, the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary can help ensure that adjacent Offshore Wind farms avoid critical ecological and cultural resources.
The Initial Boundary Alternative, which is the largest proposed boundary, will ensure an unfragmented buffer of ocean protection, while directing Offshore Wind development to more suitable areas further offshore where wind energy is optimal and ecological and cultural impacts can be reduced. The sanctuary will also allow for robust monitoring and research needed to understand the long term impacts of Offshore Wind.

Please pass legislation to protect the largest possible area of Central California ocean, an important part of biodiversity and habitats, for ocean research and education for present and future generations to come. It would be most fitting to call it the “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary.” Let's follow their lead -- a lead which has lasted for thousands of years.

Buenas tardes, my name is Juan Rosas, I’m speaking on behalf of the Hispanic Access Foundation Por la Creación Network. Today, I want to express our strong and unwavering support for the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary.

This proposed sanctuary, encompassing the Initial Boundary Alternative and the Gaviota Coast Extension, is a vital step towards protecting approximately 7,600 square miles of ocean along the Central Coast of California. It's not just about conserving natural resources; it's about preserving biodiversity, critical habitats, and the rich cultural history of our Indigenous communities.

As a faith leader and a member of our community, the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary holds a special place in my heart. It's where we come together with our families and our church communities on the beach, where we participate in and observe baptismal ceremonies. The ocean has always played a crucial role in our lives, providing recreation, spiritual fulfillment, community bonding, and economic well-being.

But it's not just about us. It's about ensuring that future generations can benefit from a clean, safe, and healthy marine environment. It's about granting marginalized Latino communities and other local communities equitable access to a clean and safe ocean and coastline for recreation, livelihoods, and culture.

We envision a future where wetland, coastal, reef, and underwater ecosystems are protected and restored, enhancing coastal resilience against rising sea levels, flooding, and other effects of climate change. We dream of an ocean free from pollution and plastics and free from the threats of offshore drilling and mining that harm not only local communities but also the global climate.

Latinos are among the fastest-growing demographic groups living by the ocean and coast. We are the new recreational fishermen, boaters, and outdoor enthusiasts. However, our communities are also among the most vulnerable to an ocean overburdened with declining natural resources. Protecting the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary is a significant step towards addressing these challenges, promoting equity, and enhancing the well-being of the Central Coast region of California.

Furthermore, the ocean's beauty and mysteries have always captivated me. It's not just a source of recreation; it's a wellspring of knowledge and inspiration. It's an invaluable resource for both present and future generations. Establishing this sanctuary will be pivotal in advancing California and Federal 30x30 priorities and the Biden Administration’s Justice 40 Initiative.







I wholeheartedly endorse the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, and I urge you to consider the following key points:

1. Sanctuary Boundaries: We support the largest possible contiguous sanctuary boundaries, specifically the Initial Boundary Alternative combined with the Gaviota Coast Extension 

2. Offshore Wind: While we recognize the importance of Offshore Wind as a source of renewable energy, we also acknowledge its potential environmental impacts. The sanctuary's Initial Boundary Alternative will help guide Offshore Wind development to suitable areas, minimizing ecological and cultural disruptions. 

3. Vandenberg Offshore Wind Projects The projects are sited too close to the shore, in a uniquely biodiverse location, with highly significant fisheries and unacceptable impacts to critical cultural sites.

4. Sanctuary Name: We endorse naming the sanctuary the ""Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary"" to honor the heritage of the Chumash people and recognize their enduring connection to this coastal region.

5. Tribal Collaborative Management: We support equitable, collaborative management, inclusive of all Tribal groups culturally affiliated with the proposed sanctuary area. 

6. Water Quality: We advocate for sanctuary water quality programs and regulations that prevent pollution, including runoff of sediments, oils, nutrients, pesticides, and pathogens. Collaborative local programs, such as the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary's Agricultural Water Quality Stewardship Program, should serve as models.

7. Outreach and Education: The sanctuary's outreach and education efforts should be multilingual, multicultural, and focused on underserved communities. Partnering with Tribal groups, local schools, community organizations, and educators is vital to disseminating knowledge about marine science, conservation, Chumash history, and culture.

8. Rodriguez Seamount: We support regulations to protect the Rodriguez Seamount, given its importance as a critical habitat for diverse marine life. Permanent protection is necessary to preserve this fragile ecosystem.

In conclusion, we urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, safeguarding our ocean's treasures for the well-being and enjoyment of current and future generations

My name is Sage Ono and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I live in Pacific Grove, California and to me, the ocean is a place on indecsribable beauty and value. I am an underwater photographer and spend many of my days exploring the coastlines and bordering environments. If not for the natural wonder, I would have chosen to live somewhere cheaper! Without protecting this land, its ecosystems and the people that depend on them will be devastated.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes protection from oil, gas, and other non-renewable energy development, collaborative tribal management, and robust educarion and outreach programs in order to revitalize people's relationship with their local environment.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

I am writing to express my strong support for the Proposed Chumash Marine Sanctuary and to request the incorporation of Morro Bay to Ccambria into this sanctuary, connecting it to the Monterey Marine Sanctuary. It is my belief that our beloved coastal towns have much to gain from the protection and preservation of our ocean and coast, and there is too much at stake to exclude these areas from the sanctuary.
The northern San Luis Obispo County coastline is a unique and ecologically significant stretch of coastline. It boasts an array of biodiversity, from marine mammals to various fish species and seabirds, making it a critical part of our region's ecosystem. By extending the Chumash Marine Sanctuary to encompass this area, we have a remarkable opportunity to conserve and protect these invaluable marine resources for generations to come.

Here are a few reasons why I believe it is crucial to include Morro Bay to Cayucos within the proposed Chumash Marine Sanctuary:

1. Ecosystem Preservation: This region features diverse habitats such as kelp forests, rocky shores, and sandy beaches, which support an array of marine life. Protecting these habitats is essential for the overall health of our ocean.

2. Economic Benefits: The coastal towns in the region, such as Morro Bay and Cayucos, heavily depend on tourism and recreational activities. A well-preserved marine sanctuary can boost local economies, create jobs, and sustain the livelihoods of those who depend on coastal resources.

3. Education and Research: The inclusion of Morro Bay to Cambria in the sanctuary would provide opportunities for research, education, and public awareness programs. It would help people understand the importance of marine conservation and foster a sense of responsibility toward our natural environment.

4. Climate Resilience: Marine sanctuaries serve as natural laboratories for studying the effects of climate change and ocean acidification. By expanding the Chumash Marine Sanctuary, we can better monitor and mitigate the impacts of these global challenges.

Incorporating Morro Bay to Cayucos into the Chumash Marine Sanctuary would not only benefit our local communities but also contribute to NOAA's mission to protect, conserve, and manage the nation's coastal and marine resources. I urge you to consider the broader implications and the necessity of safeguarding this pristine coastal area for current and future generations.

I appreciate your dedication to marine conservation and look forward to seeing the Proposed Chumash Marine Sanctuary expanded to connect the sanctuaries. Our coastal towns and the environment we cherish depend on it.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Alicia Van Fleet",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

I live in California, and to me, the ocean is imperative to a healthy and balanced life for all humans. Every day I visit the ocean to fill me with purpose. I am a surfer, swimmer, a naturalist for the Greater Farollones Association, and a volunteer with the Marine Mammal Center. As a surfer and rescuer of marine mammals I see and experience changes in the ocean’s health up close. In college I learned the health of the ocean is the starting point for the health of planet earth. I’ve been making efforts to care for the ocean ever since. 

I work a stressful job. When I go to the coast, my stress decreases. When I go to the coast I feel like a species in harmony among other species just living on this beautiful planet. I feel grounded.

I want to protect this stretch of ocean so my community can continue to connect with and benefit from a clean, safe, and healthy ocean. The ocean is beautiful and mysterious. There is so much we’ve learned from it and much more to be learned. A sanctuary will be an important part of ocean research and education for present and future generations.

La oportunidad
La biodiversidad marina —la variedad de vida en nuestros océanos— sustenta la salud del planeta y nuestro bienestar social y económico. El océano, donde se encuentra el 99 por ciento de todo el espacio habitable de la Tierra, hace posible la vida.
Durante más de 40 años, líderes Cchumash, miembros de la comunidad local y funcionarios electos a lo largo de la costa central de California, han abogado por el establecimiento de un nuevo santuario marino nacional para proteger de mejor manera el área oceánica a lo largo de la costa central de California. Las características únicas de esta área — que incluyen un hábitat intermareal rocoso, un cañón submarino y corrientes de agua de mar fría rica en nutrientes— están repletas de vida marina, incluidos enormes bosques de algas marinas, nutrias marinas, focas, ballenas, delfines e importantes colonias de aves. Pero esta área vulnerable está amenazada por el desarrollo petrolero en alta mar, la contaminación y el cambio climático. El propuesto Santuario Marino Nacional del Patrimonio Chumash ayudaría a proteger los ecosistemas oceánicos y costeros biológicamente productivos y diversos, y promovería la Iniciativa América la Bella de la Administración Biden-Harris, la cual apoya los esfuerzos de conservación liderados localmente en todo el país.
La Oficina Nacional de Administración Oceánica y Atmosférica (NOAA) ha abierto el proceso de comentarios públicos para el Santuario Marino Nacional del Patrimonio Chumash propuesto, y está recopilando opiniones del público, hasta el 25 de octubre de 2023, sobre un borrador del Plan de Gestión y el borrador adjunto de la Declaración de Impacto Ambiental.
La amenaza
Los recursos ecológicos y culturales frente a la costa de California están amenazados por el desarrollo del petróleo y el gas. Cualquier derrame de petróleo significativo en la región Cchumash amenazaría un área desde la Bahía de Santa Mónica hasta Santa Cruz, poniendo en riesgo casi la mitad de las aguas costeras y playas del estado. Incluso sin derrames, el continuo desarrollo de petróleo y gas en alta mar en esta región también causa contaminación del aire que afecta a las comunidades terrestres, y socava los objetivos y políticas de cambio climático de California. Las investigaciones científicas muestran que el área propuesta para protección por el Santuario Marino Nacional del Patrimonio Chumash ya está experimentando impactos del cambio climático, como la acidificación de los océanos a un ritmo que duplica el de los océanos del mundo. Los recursos naturales, históricos, arqueológicos y culturales de importancia nacional del área se beneficiarán de una gestión integral basada en la comunidad y los ecosistemas.
Dígale a la NOAA que apoyas el Santuario Marino Nacional del Patrimonio Chumash
El 9 de noviembre de 2021, la Oficina Nacional de Administración Oceánica y Atmosférica (NOAA) y la Administración Biden propusieron formalmente designar el Santuario Marino Nacional del Patrimonio Chumash. Durante el primer período de comentarios públicos, que cerró el 31 de enero de 2022, más de 30,000 personas expresaron su apoyo. Ahora que la NOAA ha completado un análisis exhaustivo de esos comentarios, el borrador del Plan de Gestión is open for a final round of public comment. está abierto a una ronda final de comentarios públicos. Su retroalimentación influirá directamente en la forma final del Santuario Marino Nacional del Patrimonio Chumash propuesto.
La NOAA organizará reuniones virtuales y presenciales para recopilar opiniones en septiembre y octubre de 2023. La información detallada sobre las fechas, horarios y lugares de las reuniones públicas está disponible en su y se indica más adelante. Participe en una de estas reuniones de comentarios, o envíe un comentario por escrito y exprese su apoyo al Santuario Marino Nacional del Patrimonio Chumash. Los comentarios públicos sobre la designación de santuario propuesta están abiertos hasta el 25 de octubre de 2023. Se espera una acción final sobre la designación a mediados de 2024.
Cada santuario es único, creado para satisfacer las necesidades de la región, por lo que la participación local es vital en esta última fase. Sin embargo, todas las voces, desde locales hasta globales, son bienvenidas a comentar; todo el mundo tiene un interés en nuestro océano.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

This area includes eel grass beds, historic Chumash sites, numerous protected marine mammals and shorebirds, the area with the highest population of sea otters on the California coast, several State Marine Conservation Areas, and rocky intertidal marine habitat considered to be one of the most diverse and abundant in the world. 
I live in San Luis Obispo and the ocean in this area and its marine life is very special to me. We frequent the beaches and other places along the coast. A member of my family is involved in ocean research in the Morro Bay estuary, which is tidally influenced by the omitted area.
I support the development of wind energy in the most environmentally and culturally responsible manner; the Sanctuary boundaries as proposed appropriately omit the waters of the offshore wind leases where the Morro Bay wind turbines will be sited. But excluding the waters of the Morro Bay region generally from the Sanctuary designation is unacceptable when, as I have read, options are available that would allow for the permitting of the subsea electrical transmission cables even if within the national marine sanctuary.

I am a naturalist, natural resource educator, retired NPS ranger, sea kayaker and boogie boarder, ocean enthusiast, and recent convert to regenerative agriculture. 
I support our local fishermen by buying wild caught directly from them, and support our local farmers buying most of our food through CSAs and the local farmers markets.

The most important points for me:
•	Original proposed boundaries.   Contiguous protection (no gap between Monterey Bay NMS and Chumash Heritage NMS) and largest area including the edge of the continental shelf
•	Yes on Gaviota Extension
•	Defer to Morro Bay National Estuary Program re: Morro bay extension.
•	No Oil, gas, mineral exploration of the coast of CA – protected by NMS
•	No seismic mapping - protected by NMS
•	Boat requirements: Cleaner fuel, Speed regulations to protect marine mammals.
•	Protect the Rodriguez Seamount (very specialized habitat)
•	Swift approval.  Get this approved as a new NMS!!!!!
I am Especially adamant about the inclusion of the area of the coast from Cambria to Los Osos to be protected as NMS – adding more protection offshore of the existing small MPA’s we have in place and NMS protecting a contiguous NMS chain (Farallones, Cordell Bank, Monterey Bay, Chumash Heritage (including Gaviota ext.), and the Channel Isl.
I’d like to see the grant/ funding opportunities for farmers – aiding in the shift to regenerative agriculture practices which will has been shown to reduce nitrogen and chemical run off, as well as helping with carbon sequestration, water absorption, and higher nutrients in our food and forage.  This would help our coastal areas deal with the extreme weather events as well, with healthier soils we have less runoff and less erosion.
I reiterate – original proposed boundaries.  This is necessary to protect our coast and our local economy here in Cambria.  Our economy is based in our coastal location, the moderating effected the ocean has on our climate, access to the ocean, ocean recreation and of course delicious seafood.  
If you exclude Cambria to Los Osos, you are funneling all detrimental activity into our area.   And by claiming this as a naming issue – you are blaming this exclusion on the tribes.  That is very problematic and disrespectful.
On this – I think all tribes with historic and current connection should have seats at the table, not just the one federally recognized tribe. And I believe there can be a special management area named for the Salinan tribe to alleviate the naming issue.
In addition:  I teach climate change and feel we need to switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy swiftly.  However,  I am skeptical about the proposed off shore wind farms – as a naturalist I am aware of the issues wind farms cause in the migratory routes of birds, bats, and pollinators.  Because of the lack of studies off shore (Motus towers are very limited of their reach to this far off shore, and don’t work well with fog – which we have a lot of here on the central coast) and the difficulty to get an accurate idea of the #s of species in the air and in the water that will be effected.  This would be a massive windfarm in an extremely important area of the coast (world biodiversity hotspot)  I think off shore windfarms off the coast of California will prove to be very problematic, and very damaging to migratory corridors in the marine environment (in water and in air).  
To that point, I think it’s absurd to exclude this area (Cambria through Morro Bay) from protection under the NMS because of federally leased rights for a project that has not been designed and has certainly not been vetted through the environmental protection lens.
For the love of God and all that is sacred!  Utilize the original boundaries plus the Gaviota extension for the broadest area of protection possible under this designation.   And let the tribes figure out how to effectively deal with the naming issue, but don’t let this hold up the process of designation.  Designate this swiftly – by summer of 2024.

RE: Support for Designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary - To Connect and Protect an Unfragmented Region Stretching from the Monterey Bay to the Channel Islands Sanctuaries

Dear Mr. Michel:

As the County Supervisor who has the privilege of representing the Gaviota Coast in Santa Barbara County, I write to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to offer my support for the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I respectfully request that you take prompt action to finalize this designation and implement the new sanctuary, to protect an unfragmented stretch of ocean and marine habitat from the southern border of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary through the entirety of San Luis Obispo County, to the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary and the Gaviota Coast.

On December 14, 2021, the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors unanimously adopted a non-binding resolution in support of the nomination of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to the Office of National Marine Sanctuaries and NOAA and this request is consistent with that action.

In addition to the biological importance of the proposed Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary area, this region holds deep cultural significance for the Chumash people. Native Americans have lived along the California coast for at least 13,000 years, and the relationship between the Chumash and the sea during that time has been profound.  Historically, the Pacific Ocean provided the Chumash with maritime resources that supported life, including food, shells for fishhooks, beads, and ornaments.  Numerous areas within the proposed sanctuary are significant Chumash sites, including Point Conception.  This point was a sacred place for ancient Chumash, as it was regarded as the gateway for the souls of the departed to exit earth and enter the heavens.  It is only appropriate that areas as culturally valuable as this one be protected within a sanctuary that holds the Chumash name. 

I specifically support the inclusion of Gaviota Coast in the southern portion of the proposed Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary boundary. The creation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary would provide resource protection and allow the Chumash Nation and local communities to work together in the future to preserve the treasured resources along California’s coast.  

One key aspect of NOAA’s current proposed designation gives me great pause: the boundary of the “Agency-Preferred Alternative.” This boundary is about 2,000 square miles smaller than the Initial Boundary Alternative proposed last year, and excludes the ecologically rich north-boundary coastlines and oceans of Morro Bay and Cayucos.

Furthermore, per recent review by a noted marine biologist, this excluded region is a biodiversity hotspot and would be a significant obstacle to the long-term protection of Central Coast marine life, including whales, sea turtles, sea lions, seals, sea otters, dolphins, sharks, and fish.

The designation documents suggest that the north-boundary exclusion is primarily intended to accommodate the infrastructure needed to support the adjacent Morro Bay Wind Energy Area. It appears, however, that the “Agency Preferred Alternative” throws the “baby out with the (ocean) water.” There is ample precedent for allowing sanctuaries to accommodate cables and other infrastructure. Also, there have been discussions about allowing the offshore wind industry sufficient time to identify its infrastructure needs, and then lay the sanctuary protections on top of those, thereby grandfathering in such infrastructure. Whatever the pathway, I implore NOAA to find a creative solution to ensure the protection of an unfragmented stretch of the Pacific Ocean between the Monterey Bay and Channel Island sanctuaries, while also enabling the successful implementation of offshore wind energy (which is critical for our carbon-free future). Thank you for your consideration; let’s seize this unique opportunity to protect the Central Coast – all of it.

To Whom It May Concern:

I see no reason why the proposed Chumash ocean sanctuary must preclude future wind or solar offshore facilities.  I believe, given the size of the sanitary, both could exist and benefit one another.

In addition, I believe the governance of the propose Chumash sanctuary would benefit by including non-Chumash in the form of ocean & marine biologists or other concerned academics from UCSB or other nearby, concerned colleges and universities.  

Otherwise, I applaud the creation of another marine sanctuary on our beloved coast.

Sincerely,

My name is Galen Keily and I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I live in Los Osos, CA and enjoy the beauty of our ocean coast daily as I call this place home. I am a fisherman, paddleboarder, and diver- these activities connect me with the ocean, an ocean that I want to be healthy, safe, and clean. The connection I feel to this place pales in comparison to what I imagine members of indigenous cultures feel who have called this place home for hundreds or thousands of years. For this sanctuary to bear the Chumash name and include co-management with modern day indigenous groups has me very excited to support this designation. 

I am strongly in support of the Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension to preserve connectivity with the Monterey Bay NMS, and protect cultural sites and natural resources that would otherwise be left out. I wish for the sanctuary to be called “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary” in honor of the great Chumash cultures that have called these seas home since time immemorial. I am strongly supportive of the emphasis of tribal co-management and the strategies defined in the Indigenous Cultural Heritage Action Plan.
I also support a prohibition on oil and gas development, as well as protection from invasive wind energy projects within the sanctuary boundaries.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

I’m also an illustrator and 
the daughter of a biology teacher and environmentalist. I have grave concerns about the fate of the California coast.

I commend NOAA for helping to put forth this Chumash National Marine Sanctuary in a place that indeed needs protection from human degradation.
However, I am strongly against excluding Morro Bay, which is no less important than any other location on the Central Coast, if not more so.
SAVE MORRO BAY along with the rest of the wildlife rich central coast, and STOP the destructive development of OFF SHORE WIND FARMS!!
The rare otter population, the plethora of sea birds, the humpback whales, countless fish species and delicate balance have NO BOUNDARIES!. 
They will be disturbed and destroyed by Wind-Farm exploration, construction, cable laying, constant maintenance and NOISE produced during the installation and FOREVER! That constant drone of multiple turbines reverberating through water will deafen, inhibit communication and navigation, and drive away whales, porpoises and seals, boat strikes from increased traffic will kill them! Thousands of sea birds will be slaughtered in those massive blades of the many turbines and NO ONE will know how extensive that destruction of species will be. 
NO WIND POWER BUSINESS should be on our ocean, especially in a rare habitat like Morro Bay!! Morro Bay has been hacked out of the sanctuary map for the sole purpose of EXPLOITATION” 
There has been no research as to the adverse impacts and no proof of a safe way to install and operate offshore wind farms.
This is a moneymaking scheme under the guise of ""GREEN ENERGY” and the only GREEN here are the dollars that will flow into the power industry pockets.
What they and now you are suggesting is DESTROY the planet to SAVE the planet! It is nonsense and INEXCUSABLE.

Our government has lost its way, and big power companies stand to make billions. They promise jobs and money to get these destructive projects accepted by communities, but there is NO amount of money that can compensate for the environmental degradation they will cause! The amount of wildlife, beauty, cherished ocean and unspoiled beaches are priceless, and impossible to replace once spoiled. SAVE Morro Bay from being the sacrificial lamb of power industry greed, and our government's performative actions they claim will save us from climate change...it is the BIG LIE!!
We must say NO to destroying our habitats under the guise of saving ourselves and the climate! 
Include Morro Bay in the Chumash National Marine Sanctuary as designated in the original map, or Alternative 1 map plus 5-B supplemental map.
The largest possible boundary is preferred, including the Gaviota Coast Extension and Morro Bay with oil, gas and wind farm construction being banned from the area.
There are better and less destructive ways to both conserve and produce power. Don’t allow the energy industry to exploit and abuse our last vestiges of wilderness and preserved habitats.
Our oceans are our life support system, and that system, including its wild inhabitants, deserves respect and protection from detrimental human exploitation.

I’m commenting today in support of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary (CHNMS), as well as to recommend that the sanctuary boundaries include the entire Santa Lucia Escarpment, part of which was cut out in the updated proposed boundary lines. 
The area of the proposed CHNMS captures a unique transition zone between the warm southern waters and cooler waters in the north. Along with the effect on wind and mixing from Point Conception, this results in productive foraging habitat for a diversity of marine predators. Through my research, I’ve found that the density and diversity of seabirds here is higher than outside of the originally proposed sanctuary boundaries. The unique location of this sanctuary would capture that warm-cold water transition zone and the variety of species that use the coastal and offshore habitats in this region. In addition to the important coastal habitat, the original boundaries captured a high proportion of offshore habitat, which is extremely important for migratory species that use these waters as their non-breeding feeding grounds. In total, I’ve found that 73 seabird species use this habitat, with 81% of the birds recorded here being migratory species. Protecting these important foraging grounds are critical for these highly vulnerable species. 
I especially want to highlight that within the section of the northeast corner of the original boundary, over the Santa Lucia Escarpment, I have identified it as an ecological hotspot. Our data shows there is a high abundance of seabirds and marine mammals that use these waters, which is likely due increased ocean mixing from the complex seafloor. We will also be conducting a focused Santa Lucia Escarpment research cruise in May 2024 to further explore this ecological hotspot. The newly updated boundary goes right through this productive and important habitat. This change would result in a tremendous loss of opportunity by excluding this unique habitat, and I ask that this be more thoroughly, ecologically evaluated. To include this in the CHNMS would help protect this rare productive offshore habitat for multiple species, many of which are federally and/or internationally protected. 
Because of these reasons, which show the ecological importance of this region, in addition to the cultural significance for the Chumash People, I continue to support this designation. I hope that the boundaries will be further evaluated, not only based on wind energy plans, but on the underlying marine ecosystem. As of now, our evidence only supports that the offshore waters in the northeast section capture a biological hotspot and will be a missed opportunity to protect this unique region.

I disagree with NOAA selecting the Alternative 2 Proposed Boundary. Moving the northern boundary of the originally proposed Initial Boundary Alternative will creating a 10 mile gap between the existing southern boundary of the Monterey Bay NMS and the originally proposed northern boundary. I would like to address some of the NOAA justifications for making this boundary change:
(1) The name of the proposed NMS has been rejected by the Salinas tribes, who have historical cultural ties with the coast between Cambria and Morro Bay, because the proposed name does not include them. I think the best way to address this controversy is not by excluding this area from the proposed NMS. Instead, simply add the name Salinas into the proposed name to read ""Chumash and Salinas Heritage National Marine Sanctuary"". Surely the proposed NMS can be inclusive enough for all Indigenous tribe stakeholders, including the name.
(2) Alternatives 2-4 adjust the originally proposed northern boundary southward to create a 10 mile corridor outside of the originally proposed NMS. This change would allow the future installation and maintenance of approximately 30 electrical power cables to take place outside the proposed NMS. These electrical power cables are planned to go from the ocean wind turbine farms to the Morro Bay coastline, where they can be connected to existing power grid infrastructure. Although this boundary adjustment would potentially simplify the permitting process for the project proponents, a detailed, lengthy NEPA review process would still have to be completed. And the actual environmental impacts caused by these electrical power cables would be the same, regardless if it happens within the proposed NMS or outside of the NMS. As stated in the paragraph Offshore Wind Development - Federal Waters on page 173 of the DEIS, there is an existing permit process that ONMS can use to authorize the installation and maintenance of these electrical power cables within the proposed NMS. This same process has already been used for installing fiber optic cables within a NMS. Considering the unique importance of the already planned ocean wind farm projects, I think the electrical power cables can be installed within the boundary of the Initial Boundary Alternative. 
(3) As stated in Table 5-1, the Initial Boundary Alternative has Significant Beneficial Impacts for physical resources, biological resources, commercial fishing and aquaculture resources, cultural heritage and maritime resources, DoD and Homeland Security activities. I believe all of these Significant Beneficial Impacts should not be overlooked for the temporary conveniences afforded to NOAA and future developers by avoiding the NMS naming controversy and future developer permitting issues.
(4) I have additional concerns with the 10 mile gap along the northern boundary of the Initial Boundary, as proposed by Alternative 2. I believe the Draft EIS does not adequately address the future adverse impacts that could be created from the 10 mile gap. If Alternative 2 were to be selected for the proposed NMS, then the ocean area with this gap between NMSs would not have the protections offered by a NMS. Cetaceans and other wildlife who migrate along the California coast within the Monterey and proposed NSMs would have a lapse of protections once they entered the 10 mile gap area. This situation could potentially harm migrating wildlife in this area. It could also harm local fish populations over time. The original idea of the Initial Boundary Alternative is to have a shared boundary from the Monterey NMS to the proposed NMS. This allows for the uninterrupted protection of all migratory species within these NMSs. It is for these reasons that I think it's a bad idea to change the original northern boundary as presented in the Initial Boundary Alternative.
Alternatives 1- 4 moves the original westward boundary further eastward, away from the continental shelf's edge. I read the purpose of this boundary change is to reduce the size of the proposed NMS, making it more manageable to oversee. I don't know if any potential adverse environmental impacts that could be caused from this boundary change was adequately addressed in the DEIS? Would migrating ocean fauna within the western areas left out of Alternatives 1-4 be impacted by not being included within the proposed NMS? 
Considering my above comments, my preferred boundary alternative is the Initial Boundary Alternative.
Thanx for considering my comments.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

I’m supporting the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary for the preservation of the ocean and coastline of California. I fully support the selection of Sub-Alt 5b as it is the most robust and best of the Sanctuary designs.  
I’m also in favor of the development of wind energy off the coast of Morro Bay. Under NOAA’s administration the development of wind energy can be managed in the most environmentally sensitive way. I am an environmental professional with a career in protecting our coastline and am inspired with the possible protection provided in the CHNMS. I knew Fred Collins the man who brought this proposal forward and I hope that his vision will be implemented.

My name is Monique Grajeda and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I live in San Luis Obispo, CA and to me, the ocean is the life blood to our planet and existence as well as a spiritual and universal conduit to our connection with what is beyond .

We as humans go to the ocean and stare because we are drawn to its power and purpose. It is a world of its own and should be our true focus and priority.
We depend on the ocean for recreation, our spiritual well-being, our community connections, and our economic health.
I want to protect this stretch of ocean so my community can continue to connect with and benefit from a clean, safe, and healthy ocean.
The ocean is beautiful and mysterious. There is so much we’ve learned from it and much more to be learned. A sanctuary will be an important part of ocean research and education for present and future generations.
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes: 

Biggest Possible Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension
Sanctuary Name: The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”
Tribal Collaborative Management: An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management.
Outreach & Education: Outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities
Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity
Ban Oil & Gas: A prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

This will effectively open these waters up to not only the proposed windfarm, but to oil drilling platforms, the latter of which could ruin the entire coastline including the sanctuaries north and south.

I do understand the consideration of NOAA regarding cables from a proposed windfarm. However, cables the lead out to a floating windfarm could easily be permitted or excepted from the sanctuary requirements, given the reality that a move to alternative energy sources would effectively help preserve all of our oceans from a carbon standpoint, making such a wind farm appropriate for a marine sanctuary.

Therefore, I respectfully request that NOAA approve the Initial Boundary Alternative with the Gaviota Coast Extension (Alternative 1 with Sub-Alt 5b); which includes the waters offshore of Point Buchon, Morro Bay, Cayucos, and Cambria as well as the Gaviota extension.

I urge you to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with its originally proposed boundaries adding Sub Alternative 5b to also protect the. Gaviota Coast.

I support the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary (CHNMS) name. It is meant to recognize people that have lived on this coast for over 10,000 years; protect the heritage of the Chumash, an ocean-going band among the First People of the Pacific Coast; and provide a timely and appropriate reminder of the cultural origins. Leaders and members of the Northern Chumash Tribal Council initiated, sustained, and continue to lead the effort on this designation, in part due to their historic and current presence on this part of the coast. While they are not a Federally recognized tribe, their claim to this space is valid. (Federal recognition is a structure set upon Indigenous peoples that does not acknowledge indigenous ways of knowing and being.) I support equitable inclusion of all Central Coast Tribes, both federally and non-federally recognized Tribes, in collaborative management.

As an educator and teacher educator, I know it is vital that Sanctuary education and community outreach should partner with area schools to share information about sanctuary species and habitats and Chumash history and culture. Outreach should be multilingual, culturally relevant, and should focus on underserved communities.

I support regulations to protect Rodriguez Seamount. The seamount provides critical habitat for an extremely diverse and abundant array of marine life and deserves to be granted strong and permanent protection. The seamount has special national significance that warrants special protections through sanctuary designation. Once damaged, fragile seamount ecosystems may not recover in our lifetime.

With plans for future Offshore Wind (OSW) farm development off the Central Coast, the proposed CHNMS will help protect important habitats and cultural sites and direct OSW development to less sensitive areas of the Central Coast. California’s first offshore wind projects should be done smartly and reflect leasing, siting, and permitting decisions that are guided by planning and comprehensive scientific research on the potential impacts to sensitive marine areas, species, and coastal resources, including cumulative impacts.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage NMS. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage NMS to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

I was an Environmental Sciences and Management student for both my undergraduate and graduate degrees at Cal Poly. I express my full support for the proposed Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. Any potential name changes in the interest of incorporation of the Salinan people must center and elevate the presence of the indigenous stewards of the coastline--including the Salinan peoples. The original proposed boundary should be respected in accordance with the recommendation of the Chumash peoples to incorporate as much of California's precious coastlines as possible-- extending from Cambria past Gaviota to ensure that all of the coastline between the Monterey and Channel Islands Sanctuaries are protected to the maximum extent possible from all future oil and gas related perturbations. The management of the sanctuary must incorporate the voices of all indigenous groups on the Central Coast who have stewarded the land and water for millennia to prioritize restoration and the maximum preservation of marine life from seismic testing, overfishing, and additional threats to ecosystem vitality. California's marine ecosystem is amongst the most biodiverse in the world; no part of the Central Coast should be excluded from Sanctuary protections. In a time with unprecedented extinction, endangerment, and threatening of species, consider the critical role that this complete sanctuary will play for centuries into the future. I look forward to the final approval of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary! Best,

I write to support designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover approximately 7,600 square miles of ocean to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I live in California. To me, the ocean is a sacred haven for fish, wildlife, and humans alike. When I go to the coast, I wade in the surf, explore the beach, watch the birds and people, and gain solace and strength for the coming day. The ocean is so important to me and my spouse. We depend on it for recreation and our spiritual well-being. 

I want to protect the stretch of ocean included in the proposed sanctuary so my and other communities can continue to connect with and benefit from a clean, safe, and healthy ocean.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary include the largest possible area. 

Thank you.

My name is Sophia Marquez and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I live in San Luis Obispo and work as a wildlife biologist. And currently, there is no more important issue than protecting our coasts and involving indigenous peoples in those decisions. 

Sample Descriptions of Relationship to the Ocean (Please restate so it’s specific to you):

The ocean is personally important to me. We depend on the ocean for recreation, our spiritual well-being, our community connections, and our economic health.
I want to protect this stretch of ocean so my community can continue to connect with and benefit from a clean, safe, and healthy ocean.
The ocean is beautiful and mysterious. There is so much we’ve learned from it and much more to be learned. A sanctuary will be an important part of ocean research and education for present and future generations.
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes: 

Biggest Possible Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension
Sanctuary Name: The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”
Tribal Collaborative Management: An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management.
Outreach & Education: Outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities
Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity
Ban Oil & Gas: A prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

Sophia Marquez ",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

I am lucky.  Some would be surprised to hear that if they saw me. More than 30 years ago, my own car inexplicably popped out of gear in my own driveway and ran over me.  It severed my spinal cord in six different places, and the engine block ended up resting on my face, scalding half of it. But soon after I started my new life from a wheelchair, my husband and I bought a house in Morro Bay.  From our front deck, we watch the peaceful, beautiful ocean of Estero Bay; from our kitchen window, we can see whales pass by on their migration to and from northern and southern climes; from the state park below us, I can use an accessible beach chair to get to the beach and watch otters frolic and dolphins play.  How lucky I am.

I am also lucky to be alive at a time when the NOAA appears close to establishing the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary.  What a gift this sanctuary will be to the species that occupy that portion of the ocean and to the people who visit and/or live near it. Thank you, thank you to the NOAA for its diligence and incredibly hard work throughout this designation process. I urge you to complete the process as quickly as possible.

On the flip side, I am disheartened by the possibility that NOAA will adopt an alternative that does not protect the coast from Cambria to Morro Bay.  I urge NOAA to adopt the Initial Boundary Alternative with the Gaviota Coast Extension. Excluding any part of the 2,000-square-mile section of ocean between Cambria and Morro Bay will be devastating to marine species that do not recognize the proposed human boundaries and will suffer from the disruption and pollution that would be allowed in an area that, despite the exclusion, will still be habitat to many threatened species. 

The agency-preferred alternative states that the Point Buchon/Morro Bay-Cambria area must be omitted because of the proposed wind-energy development. 
However, knowing that offshore wind farms may be a part of the sanctuary environment, NOAA could establish a process for permitting the proposed wind-energy activities. Adopting the Initial Boundary Alternative plus extensions and including wind energy as a potential use would protect the entire region from climate-destructive activities such as oil and gas drilling.  

Designating the sanctuary with the largest possible boundary would lead to multiple benefits. The Initial Boundary Alternative would connect the new sanctuary with the existing Channel Islands National Marine and Monterey Bay National Marine sanctuaries to offer contiguous protection of most of the California Coast from oil and gas drilling and other damaging uses. Creating a sanctuary with the largest boundary would most effectively protect local Indigenous communities’ cultural history, including Morro Rock. Using the largest boundary, including both extensions, would leave the character of the Central Coast and its waters intact. Selecting the Initial Boundary Alternative and extensions would support the recovery of endangered and threatened marine species and environments. This alternative would protect the only eelgrass bed in a 300-mile stretch of coast; many historic Chumash sites, including Lisamu’ (Morro Rock); numerous protected marine mammals and shorebirds; the highest population of Southern sea otters on the California coast; several State Marine Conservation Areas; and the kelp forests and rocky intertidal habitats considered to be some of the most diverse and abundant in the world.

The agency-preferred alternative states that the Morro Bay-Cambria area must be omitted from the sanctuary because local Indigenous people cannot agree on a name for the area. I’m sorry – what??!!!??  We cannot afford to leave a 2,000-square-mile stretch of ocean unprotected because of a dispute over the name.  Please.  This is not the time for NOAA  to throw up its hands and give up on the idea that there is a naming solution that satisfies all tribes.  Please continue to work on such a solution. One option: the stretch in question could be named as a subset of the Sanctuary. Great minds have been working for years on the designation of this Sanctuary.  Surely, these great minds can reach a solution amenable to all stakeholders. Please do not leave a huge stretch of ocean unprotected because of a dispute over what it shall be named.
In summary, I commend NOAA and its partners for proposing the new Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, and I ask you to designate the sanctuary as soon as possible. I strongly urge NOAA and its partners to select the Initial Boundary Alternative, plus both extensions and strong protection for the Rodriguez Seamount, to afford the best long-term protection for this diverse and fragile environment. Thank you for all you have done.  Please don’t exclude the Morro-Bay-to-Cambria section of this miraculous sanctuary.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

Including the waters between Point Buchon and Cambria will close a biodiversity protection gap along the California coast.

Excluding any of these waters is unacceptable when multiple options are available that would allow for the permitting of the cables and infrastructure needed for the adjacent offshore wind area and would not require the permanent exclusion of 2,000 square miles of ocean from sanctuary protection. The National Marine Sanctuary Program should work closely with state and federal partners, OSW companies, Tribes, and community members to ensure off-shore wind is developed in the most environmentally and culturally responsible manner.

No other proposed alternative is adequate to this purpose. The Environmental Impact Statement acknowledges that all other alternatives would variously reduce the significant beneficial impacts on biological resources provided by the Initial Boundary Alternative to “moderate” or “minor” by comparison and increase the vulnerability of those resources to adverse impacts that the Initial Boundary Alternative would prohibit or mitigate. The alternatives that truncate the Initial Boundary Alternative would impact the many species that migrate through the unprotected areas, impacts that would go far beyond the wind farms' cable corridors.

My name is Anna Costello Duran and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I live in San Luis Obispo, California, and will be directly impacted by the sanctuary, benefitting from cleaner ocean, increased research and educational funding, and the collaborative local and indigenous management of our water ecosystems. The ocean and gorgeous Central Coast beaches are some of the most iconic and beloved parts of this area. We locals love leisure, recreation, and fishing in the beautiful ocean! It is imperative that we protect our ocean from toxic waste, offshore drilling, and ocean mining, which will prevent future generations from benefitting from these important natural resources. 

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes: 
* Timely Completion: Please complete this sanctuary designation as swiftly as possible and by next summer 2024 in order to ensure protection of our oceans in a bipartisan manner.
* The Largest Possible Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension in order to prevent offshore drilling and continuity with other nearby ocean sanctuaries. With small gaps in continuity, the “edge effect” will damage the protection of the entire sanctuary ecosystem as a whole.
* Sanctuary Name: It is important to listen to and take action to address the needs and concerns of all indigenous peoples to cultivate inclusion. Sub-names would be a great solution if there are alternate name suggestions for specific areas of the sanctuary that are offered by different Tribes.
* Tribal Collaborative Management: An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management. It is important to allow for participation from non-federally recognized tribal peoples to honor the wisdom and rights to this land of the first peoples.
* Outreach & Education: Outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities. These must be in multiple languages and address unique cultural understandings with factual education.
* Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity!
* Ban Oil & Gas: A prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries is imperative so we might begin investing in a livable future in light of global warming and the non-renewable nature of fossil fuels. 

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. Thank you, Paul Michel, for your work to hear from community members who are deeply invested in this sanctuary designation.

When I am not diving, I am reading books like The Brilliant Abyss by Helen Scales, tidepooling at Asilomar State Beach in Pacific Grove, kayaking in the Elkhorn Slough of Moss Landing, attending ocean art exhibits and celebrations at local forums or taking invigorating cold plunges at San Carlos Beach in Monterey. To say that our beautiful ocean nourishes my whole being is an understatement.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes the following: 

- Ensuring the Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension is critical. I had the wondrous experience of conducting Reef Check surveys out of Morro Bay down to Montaña de Oro and Point Buchon. This is a stunning beautiful area and deserve the most protection possible.

- The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”

- Outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities. Diversity and expanded awareness is key to stoking public interest, passion and therefore good decision making with regards to the ocean

- The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity. Seamounts are treasure troves of life that further study would allow scientists to make breakthroughs in medicine, geology and more.

- A prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries. Allowing this development within the area is antithetical to the base purpose of the sanctuary.

The Earth is in a state of crisis, and we know, as a scientific fact, that the best way to save our home and ourselves is to aid nature’s incredible self-healing by sanctifying areas to enforce the natural symbiotic connection that we humans have with it. The Chumash people embody this connection, and supporting the tenets above are critical in recognizing and uplifting this. 

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary.

Given the facts of climate change and the overwhelming impacts it has, including in this area on the ocean life;  I do not think it would be prudent to exclude  potential wind energy development within CHNMS (including cables that may need to pass through the area).   I feel that these two uses (Sanctuary creation and off shore wind) are not mutually exclusive.  There can be both.  While there may be minor impacts to the Sanctuary from off shore wind energy development, it far outweighs the impacts of continuing to burn fossil fuels to create energy.  
Please write the rules for the CHNMS to allow for off shore wind to be developed within it's boundaries.

My name is David Williams and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I live in Los Angeles, California, and to me, the ocean is vital

* When I go to the coast, I am soothed by observing the the natural ecosystems in the ocean.
* The ocean is personally important to me. We depend on the ocean for recreation, our spiritual well-being, our community connections, and our economic health.
* I want to protect this stretch of ocean so my community can continue to connect with and benefit from a clean, safe, and healthy ocean.
* The ocean is beautiful and mysterious. There is so much we’ve learned from it and much more to be learned. A sanctuary will be an important part of ocean research and education for present and future generations.
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes: 
* Biggest Possible Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension
* Sanctuary Name: The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”
* Tribal Collaborative Management: An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management.
* Outreach & Education: Outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities
* Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity
* Ban Oil & Gas: A prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

My name is Elisa C. Escobar and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I live in South Lake Tahoe, CA and to me the ocean is important because we depend on the ocean for recreation, our spiritual well-being, our community connections, and our economic health. The health of the ocean is integral to not only the health of humans, but to the health of our entire planet. The ocean is irreplaceable and we must protect it for the survival of future generations.

I want to protect this stretch of ocean so my community can continue to connect with and benefit from a clean, safe, and healthy ocean.
The ocean is beautiful and mysterious. There is so much we’ve learned from it and much more to be learned. A sanctuary will be an important part of ocean research and education for present and future generations.
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes: 

Biggest Possible Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension
Sanctuary Name: The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”
Tribal Collaborative Management: An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management.
Outreach & Education: Outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities
Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity
Ban Oil & Gas: A prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

My name is Angela Chu and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I live in San Jose, CA, and to me, the ocean is a precious part of our lives on earth and that we have a choice to treat it with care and respect.

Nothing will ever make up for the violence against indigenous people then and now, and this designation seems a small step in the right direction.

Environmental preservation is a desperate issue since so much beautiful and important land and ocean is being lost so easily and quickly.

 It is vital that the CHNMS cover the largest possible contiguous boundaries. I support designation of the Initial Boundary Alternative with the Gaviota Coast Extension (Sub-Alt 5b). Including the waters offshore Point Buchon, Morro Bay, Cayucos, and Cambria will close the California Central Coast’s biodiversity protection gap between Monterey Bay and Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuaries. This will protect the only eelgrass bed in a 300-mile stretch of coast; many historic Chumash sites, including Lisamu’ (Morro Rock); numerous protected marine mammals and shorebirds; the highest population of Southern sea otters on the California coast; several State Marine Conservation Areas; and the kelp forests and rocky intertidal habitats considered to be some of the most diverse and abundant in the world.
Offshore Wind. While a source of renewable energy, Offshore Wind (OSW) farms will have environmental impacts on habitat, wildlife, and water quality. California’s first OSW projects adjacent to the sanctuary should be planned and sited to avoid or mitigate impacts to sensitive marine areas and species and important cultural resources. The National Marine Sanctuary Program should work closely with state and federal partners, OSW companies, Tribes, and community members to ensure future OSW is developed in the most environmentally and culturally responsible manner.
Water Quality. The CHNMS should prohibit oil and gas exploration, development and production; phase out existing fossil fuel infrastructure and leases; reduce land and ocean-based pollution; and partner with the local communities to improve conservation of the Central Coast.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

My name is Sedonia Thierry and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I live in San Luis Obispo, California and to me, the ocean is completely vital to the lives of every organism both living in it and on land. No matter what one's role in society is, the health of the ocean will have an impact on you, whether you can see it or not.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes: Tribal collaborative management, that will allow people to access and manage their ancestral lands that they have stewarded for generations, as well as the name ""Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary""; banning new oil and gas development that would only serve to damage the ocean and ecosystems that rely on it; the protection of the Rodriguez Seamount that will promote biodiversity; outreach and education that will foster an appreciation and a knowledge of the environment.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

The cultural heritage of the Native People who have lived on our Coast for thousands of years must be preserved.
Additionally, scientific research could bring grant money for study on climate change, medicine, habitat loss, wave energy and much more. The sanctuary would be compatible with commercial and recreational fishing, protecting our water quality and sustainability. San Luis Obispo's coastline provides essential habitat for everything from shorebirds to aquatic animals like dolphins and migrating whales to hundreds of fish species including salmon, rock fish, cod, sole and swordfish.
The local economy would thrive with millions of dollars brought in by tourism, jobs, recreational and educational opportunities
in many languages.
It is essential that in managing the Sanctuary that all local tribal groups who want to be are invited to be involved in collaboration 
with a NOAA Tribal Liaison. 
Please designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. This is the Dream of the large majority of Central Coast residents and a positive move on all fronts. Future generations will be thankful.

I think the name is important to include Chumash because it honors the people who have tended this area the longest, and it is still their area today. I believe that co-management with Tribes, or collaborative management, whatever the Tribes want and whatever they want to call it, should be implemented because CA Tribes have the most knowledge of the waters and lands and have proven to the world that they know how to take care of it better than the industrial California/United States society which has only polluted and overfished it. The Traditional Ecological Knowledge of tribal people is real and it is beyond time for our society to respect it and the people who hold it and wish to use it in the ecosystems again. I support the creation of this marine sanctuary because I have grown up and lived in California in the Bay Area and now Mendocino County, in Fort Bragg. I have always appreciated the beauty of the CA coast and have never moved away! I grew up visiting friends in Santa Barbara and I learned about the history of oil spills there and the threat that more offshore oil drilling may be added there, and I support this sanctuary as a way to protect the ocean and coastline from more pollution than it has already experienced. Oil and gas development must be fully excluded and banned from the sanctuary, or it will just be a false sanctuary. I urge you to adopt the largest possible boundary for this sanctuary, including the Gaviota Coast Extension under consideration, because the more ocean and seamounts we can protect the better. Animals need habitat to survive, and they need as much as possible given how much has been tainted and damaged by the United States/California society. The Rodriguez Seamount in particular is one I have read about, please include it in the sanctuary because it is such a crucial location for supporting biodiversity within this ocean ecosystem.

My name is Betsy Andrews and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I live in Brooklyn, NY and to me, and I am a poet. My second book, The Bottom, was written on California's Central Coast, and it is about the coast. I have a deep love of and history with the area that would be covered under the sanctuary, and as a scuba diver diving regularly in the Channel Islands (our family keeps a boat on the coast to go out there), I have seen the Pacific change so much over the years. I know that marine sanctuaries work, and I want to see the ocean healthy. I am also a food writer, finishing up a manuscript with chef Scott Clark from Half Moon Bay's Dad's Luncheonette. It is called Coastal, and it is an homage to the Central Coast of California, an area we would like seen protected forever.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes: the Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension under the name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”; an equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management;
outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities; the protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity; and a prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

Sincerely,
Betsy Andrews",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

As Violet Sage Walker, chairwoman of the Northern Chumash Tribal Council, says: “There is so much biodiversity and critical habitat in that area.""  

I often visit Morro Bay and Los Osos, an area that is rich with natural beauty and abundant wildlife.  This area is among the most beautiful stretches of oceanfront land in the world and it is home to many, many people who are actively concerned with protecting the environment and the oceans.  I personally feel that it would be highly beneficial to include the coastline near Morro Bay in the final plan for the NOAA marine sanctuary.  This is an area that is treasured for its unique, diverse, and stunning natural beauty, and it deserves to have its coastal areas placed under official protection for years to come.  In my opinion, adding the 30 mile stretch of coastline, including the areas bordering Morro Bay and Los Osos, to the marine sanctuary plan, would be an important gift to future generations; a symbol of respect to a natural environment that is both beautiful and vital to the sustaining of many types of wildlife.

After several centuries of horrible extraction and pollution, our ocean and shores need some serious and dedicated protection, for the respect and recovery of the diversity of sea life that remains, which also supports human life both directly and indirectly in so many ways. This is why the Sanctuary should have the largest possible boundary, which would provide a critical link between the Monterey Bay and Channel Islands Sanctuaries. 

Meanwhile, it is long past time that we begin the process of reparations with the Tribes whose land and waters were stolen and exploited to create this country. The most important thing to me about this marine sanctuary is that it not be in name only, although naming it after Chumash (and Salinan?) is very important. There must be true collaboration and partnership with Chumash and other involved Tribes, them leading the way with their millennia of experience stewarding this area, fully supported by us and all related government agencies. Their sacred sites must be honored, and visitors educated about the deep history and wisdom between people and place, which can help us all get on a much more connected, and sustainable, path for the future.

Also, if this is indeed a ""sanctuary"", it seems obvious that no oil and gas development should be allowed within its boundaries (really, no new oil and gas development should be allowed anywhere), nor should acoustic testing/pollution be allowed, which does great harm to underwater resident communication. If wind energy is located in the vicinity, it must be done in such a way that it does no harm to the seafloor or other features and creatures. I also completely support the prohibition of introducing or otherwise releasing an introduced species into the sanctuary, and there should be no exemption for striped bass. There should also be no exemption for DoD activities, they are already one of the greatest polluters and destroyers in the world, and we must finally stand up to them and force them to change their ways. In general, Tribes should be the ones deciding which activities are appropriate within this Sanctuary, to ensure the rebalancing and thriving of these ecosystems into the future. 

Thank you for moving this proposal forward, and committing to the future of Tribal co-management, which is critical for our healing as a nation.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

My name is Gaelila McKaughan and I support the quick designation of Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I’m a student at UCSD studying marine ecology at the Scripps Institute, and I’ve seen firsthand the importance of community involvement in ocean conservation. People want clean safe and lively oceans, preserving the biodiversity of the seas that support and enrich their local communities.

For the sanctuary, I support the Gaviota Coast Extension of the boundary, involvement of local tribes in collective management, and prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries. It’s so important, now more than ever, to protect our oceans biodiversity and ensure clean oceans for generations to come.

However, the boundary of the sanctuary will most benefit our region and wildlife if contiguous with the southern border of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary.

This area has been important to the Chumash people for much longer than any of us Europeans have been around on North America. It's time to steward the land and oceans and other waterways like our Indigenous citizens have for millennia. We can fully reverse climate change--and every step we take to slow the heating of the planet, the degradation of the waterways, and extinction of species is a positive step.

My name is Lindsey Twigg and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I currently live in New York but was born and raised on the Southern California coast. To me, the ocean is a vital living relative. When I visit the coast, I visit a vast grandmother whose wisdom, comfort, and vastness is crucial to the vitality of our way of life. It is my sincere desire that we, as proud Californians, learn to live in right relationship with both land and sea. For me, that means protecting the vast ecosystem that is currently under threat by further development.

I vigorously support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge NOAA to honor the original plan to include biggest possible boundary (The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension). I ask that it be properly named the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary so as to honor our land and sea defenders who have worked tirelessly to protect their ocean relatives. I also as that an equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management so that present and future Chumash members may restore their relationship to the ocean, and by extension, perhaps teach us how to better be in right relation with Mother Ocean. Perhaps most importantly, I also urge you to prohibit new oil and gas development within sanctuary boundaries. New developments of fossil fuels would effectively nullify the purpose and name of sanctuary, effect further harm upon the Native Tribes involved, and render this project effectively useless.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

I am writing in regard to the proposed Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary.

I live in Morro Bay and work as an outdoor education director up in Cambria. When the proposed boundaries for the Sanctuary were released, I was surprised and disappointed that the area between Morro Bay and Cambria--two places I know and value dearly--was not included. 

As an outdoor education director, I oversee programming that reaches approximately 2,000 kids a year. Some are local and some are coming from landlocked states such as Colorado to see and experience the California coast. Something we discuss at length in our programming is sustainability and the importance of healthy ecosystems. We talk about overhunting and the enormous decline in abalone populations, we discuss ochre stars and their importance as a keystone species, we have students reflect on why it's so important to experience wilderness and care about it. We try to give our students hope for a vibrant and ecologically rich future in the face of so much climate change.

Something we also discuss is how western scientists and settlers frequently try to implement ideas with good intentions, and then sometimes how they go wildly wrong. Like ice plant, for example, a plant that was introduced to help curb erosion and is now a spreading disaster up and down the coast. People genuinely believed that introducing this plant would be helpful, but it turned out to be detrimental to the ecosystem and native species.

I worry that this is also true of the proposed wind turbine area off the coast, which is the primary reason stated that the stretch from Morro to Cambria was not included. None of the research or details released by any organization convinces me that we know enough about the turbines to confidently say that no harm will come to the ocean and the ecosystem. We've seen enough oceanic and environmental disasters, and we should be thoughtful about proceeding cautiously. From the back deck of our dining facility, guests and staff often sit out with binoculars to watch the whale migration. What about the whales? We have absolutely no idea what the turbine field will do to their migration patterns, a natural ritual that humans only loosely comprehend.

Besides ecological concern, I am deeply disappointed that NOAA did not heed Indigenous concerns. Both the Chumash and Salinan tribes, the native peoples of these lands, have expressed support for the Sanctuary and concern about the wind turbines. Our nation has an ugly history of ignoring native concerns and stripping the once rich land of resources. In 2023, it is embarrassing, insulting, and racist to completely dismiss these people's concerns. Governmental agencies have a sordid history of performative inclusion, often only consulting or including native voices when it benefits them and when native tribes aren't asking for too much. Why are we continuing to do this? To only uplift native people when it is helpful for our own agenda, to only listen to them when it's convenient for us and when it already aligns with our plans? The United States of America has a gross and violent history with indigenous peoples, and it is hard to fathom that we are still acting out of hubris and individualism despite all of the devastation we've caused. Will we ever learn?

This feels like an incredible opportunity to celebrate native voices and ecological diversity, to act in ways that people don't expect of the government and other national agencies. In this political climate, there is so little hope and good news, and it feels like the Chumash Heritage Marine Sanctuary is a proposal that could unite and protect communities and ecosystems. What an opportunity to listen and learn from past mistakes.

I hope NOAA will consider the boundaries of the sanctuary to respect indigenous voices and to prevent future ecological disasters.

This is of such great importance for both conservation and for taking a significant step towards repair of the harm that was done, over centuries, to those indigenous inhabitants.

After decades of tribal efforts to protect the marine environment of their native land, NOAA, having worked with the tribe, now turns its back on those efforts and leaves the very area the Chumash sought to protect outside of the boundaries of the Marine Sanctuary which will bear their tribal name. It's a betrayal--and a failure to truly work with the tribe and others to maximize the benefits of the proposed Sanctuary. Most gallingly, the failure to include this sacred shore will result in even more persistent efforts to exploit it--including efforts at oil and gas development. No one disputes the need to maximize alternative energy in a climate changing world--and that appears to be the crux of the problem--the area is slated for off-shore wind development. But we need not trade one problematic form of energy for another, and we certainly don't need to do that on the backs of our indigenous neighbors. This proposed map represents a failure of consensus. It is, apparently, a nod acknowledging that the environmental safety of off-shore wind farms has not been proven. What will the effect be on the endangered otter population? What about migrating whales? The California Coast is a veritable highway of migrating marine life, you cannot carve out one area to exploit and pretend it does not have an impact on the remaining sanctuary ecosystems. The solution is more science, more study and finding engineering solutions to make renewables truly the 'safe' energy we all desperately need. This proposed carve-out, leaving the Chumash concerns on the cutting room floor, while using their name as if these boundaries really addressed their concerns, is a slap in the face and a continuation of centuries of betrayal of the indigenous people of this continent. There is an easy fix--do the work. At a minimum, grant the disputed area protection from oil and gas development, make off-shore wind facilities do the science and mitigate their negative impact. Certainly we cannot exploit the Chumash name, and their decades of effort, without protecting the very concerns that brought them to the table in the first place.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

My name is Sandy Cheek and I spent twenty years working in water quality for the California State Water Resources Control Board. I fully support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension. I know intimately the fragility of our ecosystems, and it is with that background that I strongly urge protection of Rodriguez Seamount as essential to protect biodiversity.
We must include the North Coast and Cambria south through Morro Bay. During the previous presidential administration, our former leader halted new designations and wanted to take an inventory of resources, proposing oil leases off the central California coast. At that time, my colleagues and I found the only way to utilize NOAA’s public comment site was to access it in the wee hours of the morning, because during any other time the site would fail. This experience had an almost sinister feel back then, leaving many unable to exercise their collective voice. In the shadow of this, we request the Initial Boundary Alternative with a prohibition on new oil and gas development within sanctuary boundaries.

Without sanctuary protection, these North Coast waters are left vulnerable to industrialization that will impact the environment and further impact the character of this special area. Think for a moment about what your children and grandchildren’s experience of the North Coast might be twenty years from now. I find it interesting that when speaking with locals, many informed fishermen want Morro Bay to be included. They are concerned about potential damage to their livelihood. 

I have studied the Tribal engagement issue and believe it is necessary and certainly appropriate to include the nominators (and other tribes and tribal organizations) in the collaborative management of the sanctuary. I believe the proposed name, Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, is appropriate considering the 15,000-years that the Chumash people lived on land that is now submerged beneath the waters of the proposed sanctuary, and the work of Tribal Chair Fred Collins, the original sanctuary nominator who tirelessly campaigned for over 40 years with other members of the Northern Chumash Tribal Council to establish this sanctuary, until his passing in 2022.

I live in Arroyo Grande, CA, was born and raised near the Pacific Ocean, and feel a deep connection to these waters. My free time is usually spent in, on, or around the water, as an avid kayaker, beach goer, sailor, and ocean swimmer. Just the other day, I swam with dolphins and seals off the central coast, while watching whales breach in the distance. I am blessed to say that this is something I experience relatively often. We need to protect our North Coast waters, species migration routes, and all ocean beneficial uses for present and future generations.

Sincerely,

Sandy Cheek

The size, location and other features of the sanctuary should be consistent with the official proposal submitted to NOAA by the Northern Chumash Tribal Council in 2015. Sanctuary designation will empower the Chumash Nation and local communities to work with federal and state partners to protect this vital stretch of coastal and marine waters. The designation will also stimulate marine research, education, stewardship, recreation and tourism. 
The proposed Chumash Heritage NMS is essential for the protection of the heritage of the Chumash, an ocean-going band among the First People of the Pacific Coast, and submerged Chumash Sacred sites ranging from villages to solstice alignments.

I am writing to express my support of the proposed Chumash marine sanctuary that would connect the protected waters of Northern and Southern California. As someone who grew up in San Luis Obispo County, this proposed sanctuary has been on the back burner far too long. Let me be brief. 
The Monterey sanctuary and the Channel Islands sanctuary have already shown that creating a marine sanctuary increases the health of the ocean in those areas. Additionally, people who rely on the ocean for income prefer regulated waters because it ensures stable populations of fish and marine life. The stretch of coastline between Ventura and Monterey is home to many iconic forms of wildlife that deserve protection from human intervention.
Furthermore, the Chumash people were stewards of this land far before colonial settlers upended their way of life. The colonization of Native Americans caused the erasure of their cultures. This proposed sanctuary would be a step towards visibility for the Chumash and other Native Nations— a way to show that Native people still exist and they are still trying to protect the home that was taken from them.
In conclusion, I am in support of the creation of Chumash heritage marine sanctuary because it would benefit the health and livelihoods of not just marine life but human life as well.

A concerned citizen",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

My name is Rebecca Manfredini and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension.
This option would cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean and best protect biodiversity and fragile marine habitats.
Last year, I moved to Cambria, where I hike along the ocean on a daily basis and began volunteering as a docent with Friends of the Elephant Seal. My husband and I cherish the natural beauty of the Central Coast and strongly encourage the full protection of this globally significant ecological area.
To best protect the coast, I ask that this sanctuary ban oil and gas development within these delicate waters. I also strongly encourage that Traditional Ecological Knowledge is employed as part of a collaborative management approach with the Indigenous peoples of this area.
Furthermore, I encourage more comprehensive studies of any potential impacts on air quality and wildlife within the sanctuary area from offshore wind power development, both during the construction and operational phases of the project. My fear is that this part of the coast could essentially be industrialized without fully understanding the impacts, and, that by leaving a large gap in the National Marine Sanctuary system along the California coast, this area between Cambria and Point Buchon will be vulnerable to a variety of harmful development activities. 
I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to help protect this area so that future generations can also enjoy the natural beauty, abundant wildlife, and serenity that we have come to cherish. We also hope that any and all Chumash cultural sites receive full and adequate protections.
Sincerely,

My name is Laura Piffero from the Te-Moak Bands of the Western Shoshone Nation.  I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I live in Chandler, Arizona] and to me, the ocean is sacred to all Native People.

Water is life and death, strength, change, healing, dreaming, and unconditional love.

When I go to the west coast, me and my children find peace and serenity.  The ocean is personally important to me. We depend on the ocean for recreation, our spiritual well-being, our community connections, and our economic health.
I want to protect this stretch of ocean so my community can continue to connect with and benefit from a clean, safe, and healthy ocean.

The ocean is beautiful and mysterious. There is so much we’ve learned from it and much more to be learned. A sanctuary will be an important part of ocean research and education for present and future generations.
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes: [share what you want to see in the sanctuary designation, using the messaging guidance below]

Biggest Possible Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension
Sanctuary Name: The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”
Tribal Collaborative Management: An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management.
Outreach & Education: Outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities
Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity
Ban Oil & Gas: A prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

This option would cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean and best protect biodiversity and fragile marine habitats.
Last year, I moved to Cambria, where I hike along the ocean on a daily basis. I am a writer and worked as a newspaper reporter in Lompoc during the 1980s and have written extensively about the Central Coast, both as a onetime staff writer at Sunset Magazine and as an independent journalist. I have also written a number of articles about California’s Indigenous peoples
My wife and I cherish the natural beauty and cultural heritage of the Central Coast and strongly support the full protection of this globally significant ecological area.
To best protect the coast, I ask that this sanctuary ban oil and gas development within these delicate waters. I also strongly encourage that Traditional Ecological Knowledge is employed as part of a collaborative management approach with the Indigenous peoples of this area.
Furthermore, I encourage far more comprehensive studies of the many potential impacts on air quality and wildlife within the sanctuary area from offshore wind power development, both during the construction and operational phases of the project. My fear is that a globally significant section of the coast could essentially be industrialized without a true and full understanding of what could turn out to be major impacts on this rare marine environment. And, that by leaving a large gap in the National Marine Sanctuary system along the California coast, the area between Cambria and Point Buchon will be vulnerable to a variety of harmful development activities that could severely degrade both marine and onshore environments.
In closing, I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, as originally envisioned, to best protect the area so that future generations can, like us, savor the natural beauty, abundant wildlife, and serenity that we have come to cherish. We also hope that any and all Chumash cultural sites receive full and adequate protections.

Matthew Jaffe

My name is Lorna Moore and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I live in Santa Barbara, California.  The ocean should not be a place to build things, it should remain untouched by man.  The ocean produces oxygen, provides fish to eat, and creates beautiful beaches and coastlines.  We need to protect it.

When I go to the coast, the sea air and vast ocean view rejuvenate me.  Watching marine life feeds my soul.  Viewing the sunset on the ocean should not be marred by oil rigs or windmills.

I ask that this sanctuary include the biggest possible boundary and that oil and gas rigs, wind farms, or any other structures be prohibited in the Sanctuary.  Other than environmentally balanced fishing, I ask that no new income-producing activity, profit, or ""non-profit"" be allowed within the sanctuary boundaries or along the coastline.  It should remain free to all without any favor to any group of people or organization.

I do not support NOAA’s Alternatives 2, 3, and 4 because they would not protect a critical area of coastline that contains important Chumash cultural sites, marine habitat, and local communities.

I further support the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary name. It is meant to recognize people that have lived on this coast for over 10,000 years; to protect the heritage of the Chumash, an ocean-going band among the First People of the Pacific Coast; and provide a timely and appropriate reminder of the cultural origins. I further support equitable inclusion of all Central Coast Tribes, both federally and non-federally recognized Tribes, in collaborative management. All sanctuary stakeholders will benefit from Indigenous input.

The CHNMS provides an exceptional opportunity to advance the first Tribal-nominated national marine sanctuary designation in the U.S., setting a precedent for elevating Indigenous perspectives, cultural values in ocean conservation, and Indigenous collaborative management that includes all Central Coast tribes equitably. 

I appreciate the designation of a marine sanctuary honoring the history and culture of Native Americans, specifically the Chumash people and their ancestors, known to have inhabited this region for more than 10,000 years.

I believe it's of utmost importance to do so, and am excited that this could soon become a reality.

I live in Los Angeles, CA, and to me, the Chumash territory designation represents a crucial step forward both for the area's environment to thrive, as well as the designation area to thrive, recognizing the Chumash nation as an integral part of the area's past, present and future health. I also think it's an important example being set for other states to recognize and connect indigenous knowledge with the future health of our environment - the two are inseparable. 

When I go to the coast, I explore remote areas and observe the wildlife, get a welcome break from city life, and am always amazed by the wonder of nature and its resilience. Being in touch with nature in California has taught be about resilience, perseverance, spirituality, human life both past and present, and how similar we are to wildlife, plant life and the ocean. The ocean is important to be, and we depend on the ocean for recreation, our spiritual well-being, our community connections, and our economic health.

I want to protect this stretch of ocean so my community can continue to connect with and benefit from a clean, safe, and healthy ocean.

My name is Thelma and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I live in Hawthorne, CA and to me, the ocean is west of me and I want it to be re-indigenize and returned to the people that know how to revere and protect i

When I go to the coast, I am on guard because it seems to be cordoned off for the rich and wealthy who can afford to live, pay to pay and access it.
The ocean is personally important to me. We depend on the ocean for recreation, our spiritual well-being, our community connections, and our economic health.
I want to protect this stretch of ocean so my community can continue to connect with and benefit from a clean, safe, and healthy ocean.
The ocean is beautiful and mysterious. There is so much we’ve learned from it and much more to be learned. A sanctuary will be an important part of ocean research and education for present and future generations.
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes: 

Biggest Possible Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension
Sanctuary Name: The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”
Tribal Collaborative Management: An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management.
Outreach & Education: Outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities
Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity
Ban Oil & Gas: A prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

It is time they have a say in how land is designated. We should honor their request for a comprehensive sanctuary. This would be a win win in reality.

I am active in community development and sustainable development initiatives in both San Luis Obispo and the San Francisco Bay Area.  i am also a Docent for Friends of the Elephant Seals.
I want to applaud NOAA for striking the right balance with the proposed rules.  We need to balance the protection of the ocean and its creatures with the ability to generate more clean energy uses on the Central Coast.  I agree that Morro Bay and the surrounding area should not be part of the Chumash National Marine Sanctuary.  

Generating renewable wind energy is critical to addressing climate change.  We need the wind that can be generated from the Morro Bay area to enable us to benefit from wind energy as a primary renewable source of energy.  

We need both solar and wind for our future to reduce the devastating impact of a heated planet from fossil fuels.  Excessive heat disproportionally impacts low-income people of color, especially our farmworkers who are critical to our economy.  We have already seen a cutback on rooftop solar provisions led by the utility industry.  We need wind to offset the political challenges that the solar industry is facing. 

Again, I want to encourage NOAA to implement the proposed rules.  They are balanced on conversation and energy conversation.  Thank you for reviewing my comments.  Bob Zdenek ",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

My name is Valerie K. Starkgraf and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension (sub alternative 5b) to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.
I live in Simi Valley, CA, and work in Ventura, CA and to me, the ocean is entirely vital to our lives on shore, and the kelp forest ecosystem is even more vital to preserve the health of our planet than the also vital protection of our terrestrial forests. It is the offshore equivalent of a rainforest. It is also vital for my personal spiritual health and well being. I’m a photographer, the Central Coast is my favorite place. I have pictures of this proposed sanctuary from shore that speak well of its beauty, sacredness, and vitality to Central Coast communities.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes the biggest possible Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension. We need this sanctuary to be a true bridge between my local Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary and the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary to safeguard protections for Southern Sea Otter habitat, Northern Elephant Seal habitat, and other migratory species that use this corridor to breed and seasonally migrate between the two other sanctuaries. I ask that this sanctuary include the name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary,” because without our tribal neighbors safeguarding this area of coast we would not have these resources to enjoy. I ask that there be an equitable approach to include all tribes in collaborative management, and that the outreach and education about this sanctuary include prioritization of Traditional Ecological Knowledge and access to local underserved communities. I ask for the protection of Rodriguez Seamount to protect regional biodiversity. It is a wildly unique geological feature and ecosystem feature we cannot afford to lose or mess up. I also ask for a ban on new oil and gas production within the sanctuary boundaries. This sanctuary should protect the area from harmful oil and gas development and reduce water pollution in Sanctuary waters by preventing excess runoff of sediments, oils, pesticides, nutrients, and pathogens.

I do support the wind farm, but I do not support taking scissors to the original proposed boundaries to cut a corridor for an end run around full environmental review for the cabling of that wind farm. The Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary should ensure that Offshore Wind operations and construction are completed through the guidelines of the new Sanctuary. These projects should be planned and authorized in a way that avoids and mitigates impacts to sensitive marine areas, species, and important cultural areas.

We need the full bridge sanctuary, all of it, including Gaviota.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

The ocean is beautiful and mysterious. There is so much we’ve learned from it and much more to be learned. A sanctuary will be an important part of ocean research and education for present and future generations.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes: 
* The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension
* The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”
* Tribal Collaborative Management: An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management.
* Outreach & Education: Outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities
* Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity
* Ban Oil & Gas: A prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

Dear Paul Michel,
My name is Sharon Holkey and I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.
I live in Los Angeles County in a beach town.  The ocean is my temple! I care deeply about it and all the sea life it inhabits as well as the benefits known and unknown it provides to us and Mother Earth as a whole.  I also believe in respecting our indigenous people’s ancestral lands and waters and to include them in the conversations as to how to properly maintain them for optimal health.  
I am also very concerned about the under water (wind mill) technology proposed to create green energy.  Do you know to what extent it will disrupt sea life?  I am all for developing green energy.  Are there better alternatives?
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes all listed below: 
1. The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension.  
2. Tribal Collaborative Management- An equitable approach to include all Tribes in collaborative management. 
3. Outreach and Education: Outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge and access for local underserved communities. 
4. Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity.  
5. Ban oil and gas: A prohibition on new oil and gas development within sanctuary boundaries. 
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary.  I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

Our National Marine Sanctuaries need to be just that, sanctuaries. A space of care and comfort where all God’s creation can gather.  The ocean space nominated by the Northern Chumash Tribal Council to be a sanctuary, is just a formal acknowledgement of the care that the Northern Chumash and other tribes have given these waters for generations. We support the Northern Chumash in their continued care of God’s creation.

Specifically, we support the following recommendations of the Northern Chumash Tribal Council:

Sanctuary Boundary. It is vital that the sanctuary cover the largest possible contiguous boundaries. We support designation of the Initial Boundary Alternative with the Gaviota Coast Extension (Sub-Alt 5b), including the waters offshore Point Buchon, Morro Bay, Cayucos, and Cambria will close the California Central Coast’s biodiversity protection gap between Monterey Bay and Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuaries. This will protect the only eelgrass bed in a 300-mile stretch of coast; many historic Chumash sites, including Lisamu’ (Morro Rock); numerous protected marine mammals and shorebirds; the highest population of Southern sea otters on the California coast; several State Marine Conservation Areas; and the kelp forests and rocky intertidal habitats considered to be some of the most diverse and abundant in the world.

Sanctuary Name. Creation Justice Ministries specifically supports the name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary” to honor the cultural history and stewardship of California Tribal Peoples. The name will recognize Peoples that have lived on the California coast since time immemorial and protect the heritage of the Chumash, an ocean-going band among the First People of the Pacific Coast. We want to honor the late Chief Fred Collin’s nomination and vision for the sanctuary and the 10 years of work that the Northern Chumash Tribal Council did to campaign for the sanctuary.

Tribal Collaborative Management. The sanctuary is an opportunity to advance environmental justice efforts. Creation Justice Ministries asks that NOAA keep the sacred connection between ocean and community at the heart of this effort. The Sanctuary should teach the benefits of protecting our ocean and planet and promote the spirit of stewardship that is exemplified by the culture and history of the original Chumash caretakers.

We support equitable inclusion/representation of all Central Coast Tribes in the collaborative management of the sanctuary. By being equitable and inclusive, all sanctuary stakeholders will benefit from broad Indigenous input and TEK informing management.

Equitable collaborative management must be open to all Tribal groups interested in participating. This can best be accomplished with a Tribal Sanctuary Advisory Council made up of interested Tribal Groups. NOAA’s Tribal collaboration should be facilitated by a qualified Tribal Liaison.

Outreach and Education. Sanctuary education and community outreach should partner with area schools to increase education and access to the ocean for local communities. New educational programs should focus on both ocean ecology and Tribal history and culture. Outreach should be multilingual and multicultural, and should prioritize underserved communities, such as the inland communities of Guadalupe and Santa Maria. We also urge development of research programs that address the impacts of climate change, encourage community science, and elevate the use of TEK to enhance ecosystem-based management.

Rodriguez Seamount. We support regulations to protect Rodriguez Seamount. The seamount provides critical habitat for extremely biodiverse marine life, which needs strong and permanent protection. Once damaged, fragile seamount ecosystems may not recover in our lifetime.

Offshore Wind. While a source of renewable energy, Offshore Wind (OSW) farms will have environmental impacts on habitat, wildlife, and water quality. California’s first OSW projects should be planned and sited to avoid or mitigate impacts to sensitive marine areas and species and important cultural resources. The National Marine Sanctuary Program should work closely with state and federal partners, OSW companies, Tribes, and community members to ensure future OSW is developed in the most environmentally and culturally responsible manner.

Water Quality. The sanctuary should prohibit oil and gas exploration, development and production; phase out existing fossil fuel infrastructure and leases; reduce land and ocean-based pollution; and partner with the local communities to improve conservation of the Central Coast.

With gratitude and hope,

Creation Justice Ministries

Would it be possible for process to be initiated that would see a win-win for all parties. Such processes worked in the establishment of California Marine Protected areas to my best understanding. If such a process is not in NOAA's purview, perhaps a strong recommendation to the State to make it happen could be made. I make this suggestion because I can't find it in my heart to pick one side among the heritage of the Chumash, the desperate need for green energy to protect our children's future, and the proven protections a national marine sanctuary to avoid fossil fuel exploration and sea floor mining of our nearshore waters.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

You have not clearly defined what will and will not happen as a result of this proposal and as such you leave the door open to do anything that you fell like restricting.  If you can guarantee that no resprtictions in public uses AND fishing regulations, then you should clearly state that and re-sumbit for comment, however I do not see anything that restricts you from further regulations.  As you know there are processes in place through the MPA's in place, and fishing regulations adopted by the State of California that are fully adequate to address fishing issues.  You have not said you will abide by that process which means you intend to restrict fishing further and I would say without, or ignoring, fishing interests.

For over four decades, local efforts have been based on contiguity with both the Channel Islands and Monterey sanctuaries, leaving no gaps.  The current proposal for a huge gap excluding 30 miles of coast and vast tracts of ocean are based on a vague notion that some sort of linear connection might, in the future, be made between a not yet approved, not yet formally proposed wind array, and the onshore electrical grid, coming onshore in Morro Bay.  While grandfathering of incompatible uses has many precedents, these precedents nearly always involve EXISTING infrastructure, not vague future possibilities.  We don't know whether the proposed wind array will pencil out or be approved, we don't know whether any associated infrastructure that might cross sanctuary waters would be incompatible with sanctuary management, and we don't know how the existence of a sanctuary might lead to conditions of approval that would minimize or eliminate compatibility issues.  What we can know is that the precedent of ""grandfathering"" not only a linear easement, but a 30-mile gap, based on vague possibilities about the future sets a horrifying precedent that could endanger all future conservation efforts anywhere, if all that is needed to eviscerate such a conservation effort is a vague notion that something incompatible might someday be proposed.  My reasons for supporting not only the complete sanctuary as long envisioned but also explicit inclusion of the Morro Bay Estuary include the importance of that estuary as a nursery for sea creatures who spend much of their lives in the sanctuary's outer waters, the enormous intrinsic biological and cultural value of the estuary, the estuary's calm waters (compared to the open ocean) that can welcome sanctuary visitors of all ages, including those without open ocean experience, to get ON the water in the estuary and to partake of such special features as the eelgrass beds, and the extension of the benefit of sanctuary-related water quality resources to the watersheds directly incident into the estuary, including the Los Osos and Chorro Creek watersheds and those of their tributaries.

My name is Dave Boicourt and I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension.

I live in Atascadero, California.

I believe the primary reason for approving the sanctuary in its entirety is to honor the Chumash Tribe. Throughout our nation’s history lands belonging to its indigenous people have been seized. I believe this designation (in full) would go a long way in ameliorating those wrongs.

Another reason for keeping the sanctuary in its entirety is my belief the form follows function. The shape of the sanctuary should follow organic boundaries and should not be influenced by economic conveniences like wind power.

You and I have an opportunity to complete a virtuous act. I would be so proud of you, our local community and the nation if we were able to have the sanctuary approved as it was intended. Imagine the protection our coast would enjoy with both the Monterey and Chumash sanctuaries being contiguous and extending all the way to Gaviota. 

Of course, Morro Rock needs to be included as the sacred heart of the sanctuary.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes:

The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension

The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”

An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management.

Outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities

The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity

A prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.
 
Sincerely,

Dave Boicourt

I'm a business owner in San Luis Obispo and have been a volunteer with the SLO Climate Coalition since its inception. My family and I visit many coastal areas on a regular basis to swim, paddleboard, surf and sail as a member of the Morro Bay Yacht Club. My son is a Junior Life Guard and a budding sailor who loves to frolic in the waves and often wonders about what’s under the surface. We moved here in large part because of our connection to the ocean. Protecting it like this is a rare generational opportunity. 

I support the CHNM designation with the extension along the southern coast to Gaviota. I also support the extension into Estero Bay and north to meet the MBNMS but only if it won’t cause significant delays to the creation of the wind energy area. The WEA is critically important to our climate goals in this state and the country. Ideally we could have our cake and eat it too. If that’s possible with a little extra work on your part, let’s do it! A contiguous area from Monterey down to the Channel Islands is the best possible outcome but again, not if it comes at the expense of several gigawatts of clean renewable wind energy. 

I also very much support the naming to include the Chumash and the planned collaboration with the tribe now and in the future. We have a long way to go to make things right with the indigenous people of this country. Every step we take in that direction makes a positive statement about who we are as a people because so many cultures in human history have just bowled over the “less powerful” cultures they found and took their land. We certainly aren’t the first to do so but maybe we can be the first to make peace with the “conquered” peoples and live in harmony and collaboration with them. 

Extend that metaphor to the wildlife in the ocean off our gorgeous California coast and you have my basic position: Let’s live in harmony with the wonderful gifts mother nature has given us. It’s our right and our duty, and in doing so we extend our moral authority to be the keeper of these lands. ",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

My name is Karen Boicourt. I am a California native and have lived in San Luis Obispo county for over 30 years. This past summer I heard an impassioned speech by Violet Sage Walker of the Chumash Tribal Council regarding the almost certain passage of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary after decades of work and the coordination and vision of numerous groups. At that time, the draft proposal included the coastal waters from Morro Bay north to the already designated Monterey Marine Sanctuary. It was a gut punch to many of us when the most recent draft plan excluded these coastal waters for the sole purpose of allowing a possible offshore wind energy project avoid the extra steps for approval that would be required through the sanctuary waters. It is stated in the NOAA proposal that ""a core motivation in the nomination of the sanctuary was to raise public awareness of tribal and Indigenous cultures, incorporate Indigenous knowledge into sanctuary management, and protect resources essential to these cultures"". The Chumash Tribe has an important voice in the stewardship of the sanctuary and should be heard. The small area excluded in the revised draft makes no sense when we want to protect a fluid corridor for whales, elephant seals, California sea lions, otters and other marine life that thrive in these waters. Also to be considered are the migratory birds that travel to the Morro Bay Estuary and others that live in this same area. It is imperative that to be the best stewards of our oceans and the rich biodiversity dependent on it that the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary be designated with the inclusion of the coastline and waters south of Morro Bay all the way to the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary without interruption.

We encourage NOAA to approve the largest possible boundaries, ensuring continuous protection with the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary and encompassing as much of the aquatic ecosystem as possible.

We commend the proposal for including the Chumash tribe and their interests in helping manage the sanctuary and restoring a part of their heritage.

We further urge all offshore oil drilling, exploration, and associated pipelines be banned in the Sanctuary borders, as is the case for California's other National Marine Sanctuaries.  Indeed, NOAA should take steps to end all offshore oil drilling off the California coast (and elsewhere) to address the threats posed by global warming from burning fossil fuels.

I fully support designating the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. 

Specifically, I support the ""Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension"" that will protect habitats and biodiversity throughout 7,600 square miles of ocean. We know that it is very unwise to fragment ocean protection.

The science is clear: Marine Sanctuaries not only protect ocean species from those who would take and sell the last of a kind, damaging the ocean environment by dragging/trapping indiscriminately and dumping tackle and oil that regularly ensnares and kills citizens of the sea. Marine Sanctuaries are nurseries for species that go outside the boundaries where they can be harvested, so those who are looking to profit from killing wildlife actually benefit from ocean protection, despite their complaints. 

And while wind energy is important, the current state of the infrastructure is harmful to birds and therefore unacceptable. There are other forms that can capture the power of the wind that do not kill wildlife - sails, for example - which are currently not being considered by those wanting to build and install the deadly bladed wind turbines. The technology is evolving rapidly; the market MUST develop the means to capture wind energy that does not injure and kill birds following ancient flyways. 

I've lived in San Luis Obispo County for decades, in oceanside towns called Cayucos, Los Osos, and Morro Bay. The ocean is infinitely precious and must not be further damaged, specifically by the industries of fishing, farming, and energy. The whole point of a Marine Sanctuary is to protect that which will otherwise be ravaged. It is time.

Otherwise, I heartily agree with every point in the attached document, ""NCTC (Northern Chumash Tribal Council) Messaging Guidance"". 

Thank you for doing the right thing for the life of the ocean, and for the millions of us who regard the ocean as sacred and worthy of protection.

Our family lives in Oceano, and we often use the coastal areas defined by the proposed sanctuary for photography, boating, diving and general recreational use. 
We feel this is the minimum size required to provide adequate protection for protection of the diverse aquatic life.  We support the Initial Boundary Alternative with the Gaviota Coast Extension. As California's population grows and more population is felt thru-out California, more pressure will be put on these resources. The protection of the Rodriguez Seamount is essential to fully facilitate this proposal.  We need more educational  and research programs which will help us fully realize the immensity and importance of this act.  There is much we do not know or understand about our oceans.  A complete ban on oil and gas development is a must for adequate future protections.  We have several examples of tragic spills along our Central Coast.  The environmental destruction of these activities cannot be continued, and with the technology of EV cars, trucks and equipment of all types, oil and gas drilling will be less necessary in our future. This too, will be an acknowledgement to our Native American populations that we are finally taking the necessary steps to stop the destruction of our marine life and habitat.   We support the name of "" Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary"" in honoring their contributions to the betterment of of our environmental future.  All tribes should be included in a collective management program.  This is the least that we can do as a responsible population, in consideration of the future of our children, the Native Americans, and the spirit of pro-active environmental protections.

If this requires siting windmills further away from the shoreline then the lessees will have to absorb the additional costs involved with delivery and maintenance of the windmills. This just needs to be the cost of doing business for the lessees.

The windmill construction and servicing location(s) should be located where there is already significant industrial development and infrastructure to support such activities. Existing major ports and railroad hubs/terminuses should be utilized rather than creating new ones in relatively remote locations.

The proposed marine sanctuary should be contiguous along the central coast. Leaving a relatively small gap between the Monterey marine sanctuary and the proposed Chumash marine sanctuary is clearly only for the benefit of the wind farm lessees to install and service their equipment at the expense of the environmental health of our coastline.

If the final Chumash sanctuary is contiguous with the Monterey sanctuary, the issue of placing undersea transmission cables from the shoreline to the windmills through the sanctuary would need to be resolved. Numerous subsea communication cables presently exist and terminate in Morro Bay and Pismo Beach (Reference NOAA navigational chart 18700), but none of the cables transit the Monterey marine sanctuary to the north. The proposed Chumash marine sanctuary (even if there is a gap with the Monterey sanctuary) will contain some of these existing subsea cables, particularly the cables that terminate in Morro Bay within its boundaries.

Making a significant change to the proposed sanctuary boundaries as is currently being proposed constitutes a change in scope of the wind farm project for the advantage of the lessees and should require the process for awarding the leases to be redone.

I realize there are other legal, environmental, and economic issues to be considered and I admit I'm not an expert in any of them. However, I'm a native Californian born in the late 1950s and I've lived in Fresno, Humboldt, Mariposa, Stanislaus, Inyo, and now San Luis Obispo counties. I do know that I love my state and wish to see an unobstructed horizon from the central coast to remain unchanged in perpetuity for future generations to enjoy",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

In accordance with NEPA (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq. ), NOAA is identifying as its preferred alternative the combination of Alternative 2, “Cropped Bank to Coast,” and Sub-alternative 5b, “Gaviota Coast Extension.”

This maximizes the amint to protected space while avoiding the precedent of having infrastructure within protected space. This protection is required both for existing natural resources, and to allow recovery of degraded areas withing the region. Further, the indigenous cultural regions being incorporated is equally important since all to often those uses have not been completely integrated in protected natural space, since that use is not seen as ""natural"". This shift in perception is desirable. 

However, the agency needs to find ways to incorporate both accommodation of offshore wind power and marine protection in the same space since the interest and action for both is increasing.

My name is Clare Mengebier and as a San Diego citizen I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover around 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

To me, the ocean a source of learning, growth, and life for me ever since I was a child visiting these beaches and looking out into the endless sea in awe. I want to be proud to bring the next generation to the same beaches and have these ecosystems in intact so we can continue learning from the abundant resources and life in the ocean. 

That is why I emphatically support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes: 
•	The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension
•	The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”
•	Inclusion of all Tribes in Collaborative Management
•	Education and research programs that elevate Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities
•	The protection of Rodriguez Seamount
•	A prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries

I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to create long-term opportunities to continue to learn and benefit from our ocean.
 

Sincerely,

Clare

Indeed! We need to preserve our natural habitat, it is our life giving Mother Nature, 
    Please do the correct thing and make official the natural sanctuary of Morro Bay , Chumash sacred land. Let us show respect for our  Mother Nature. 
    I grew up in SoCal,near  Seal Beach, Huntington Beach, since 1966....where the water is brownish green and animals die from the pollution. There was a time when the so-cal beaches could have been preserved...but they weren't. Look at how Global Climate Change has affected our coastal wetlands( what is left of them). For every species that goes extinct,  including species from the vegetable kingdom, there is a detrimental cascade of death that follows.  A marine sanctuary of Morro bay is not a choice but the only place left for the endangered animals that live there.  They are indigenous to our California coast line. We, as humans, have to correct the mistakes of those who came before us. We have the choice and ability to preserve our natural lands and waters for the next seven generations to come. 
 Thank you. 
   May you be blessed with a good conscience and compassion,

Mr. Paul Michel, Regional Policy Coordinator 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
99 Pacific Street, Suite 100F 
Monterey, CA 93940 

Dear Mr. Michel, 

We, the undersigned members of the San Luis Obispo County Democratic Party (SLOCDP) Central Committee, strongly support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary (CHNMS) to protect ocean biodiversity and to advance environmental justice through collaborative ocean management. 

The objective of the CHNMS has always been to fill the gap between the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary and Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary by protecting 7,573 square miles of ocean. It is vital that the CHNMS cover the largest possible contiguous boundaries, including the waters off Point Buchon, Morro Bay, Cayucos, and Cambria. 

We therefore support the Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension. All other alternatives would reduce the significant beneficial effects on biological and cultural resources provided by the Initial Boundary Alternative. 

The SLOCDP supports the thoughtful development of Offshore Wind (OSW) energy and believes that such development can be compatible with a Sanctuary of maximum extent. The National Marine Sanctuary Program should work closely with state and federal partners, OSW companies, Tribes, and community members to ensure future OSW is developed in the most environmentally and culturally responsible manner that adheres to local, regional and state environmental standards, and regulations. 

The Sanctuary should be named the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary in recognition of the history and culture of the Chumash and other Indigenous peoples of the region. Outreach, education, and research programs should elevate Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities. Outreach and education should be multilingual and multicultural. 
We support an equitable and inclusive approach to Tribal Collaborative Management that empowers all interested Tribal groups who are affiliated with the area. We also support the appointment of a qualified NOAA Tribal Liaison. 

The final management plan should ensure lasting protection of the Sanctuary’s unique and irreplaceable environmental and cultural resources. The CHNMS should prohibit oil and gas exploration, development and production; phase out existing fossil-fuel infrastructure and leases; reduce land- and ocean-based pollution; and partner with the local communities to improve conservation of the Central Coast’s enviable natural resources. We further support regulations to protect Rodriguez Seamount. 

Thank you for your consideration of these comments.

We are likely the last authentic little beach town in California located south of Cambria and north of Morro Bay.  The original designation of the proposed Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary had the northern boundary adjacent to the southern boundary of the Monterey Marine Sanctuary and included Cayucos.  The northern boundary of the now proposed Agency-Preferred Alternative now EXCLUDES Cayucos, much to the potential detriment of we who live here and the countless visitors we entertain.  A Resolution was unanimously passed at our regular meeting on October 4, 2023, to ask that Cayucos be reinstated into the Marine Sanctuary boundary.  We exist in an unique area and must preserve it.  Please don't let short term economic interests destroy our fragile and precious coast.  Thank you for your consideration.  John M.

My name is Cristina Colissimo and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I live in Los Angeles, California and to me, the ocean is a place of bountiful life and rich diverse history. When I go to the coast, I enjoy kayaking with the family and we explore the beach, watching the wildlife on land and in the sea. 
The ocean is personally important to me. We depend on the ocean for recreation, our spiritual well-being, our community connections, and our economic health.
I want to protect this stretch of ocean so my community can continue to connect with and benefit from a clean, safe, and healthy ocean.
The ocean is beautiful and mysterious. There is so much we’ve learned from it and much more to be learned. A sanctuary will be an important part of ocean research and education for present and future generations.
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes: 

Biggest Possible Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension
Sanctuary Name: The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”
Tribal Collaborative Management: An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management.
Outreach & Education: Outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities
Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity
Ban Oil & Gas: A prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries. 

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

 

Sincerely,
Cristina Colissimo

As a Christian, I'm excited to see a proposed draft management plan for the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. We need clear and meaningful management and implementation of the sanctuary. Given that the Chumash tribe, among other tribes, have been the primary keepers and sustainers of these waters and the lands that are along the coast, we must first look to them for comment and input on this draft management plan and future management plans.

Thank you for your work on this immediate need to preserve God's creation.     ",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

Dear Paul Michel,

I am Franky Prieto. I am a Highschooler and I support the design of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary.
I live in Oxnard,California. The ocean is a very important part of Oxnard due to it being 20 minutes or less from wherever you are and especially the food supply from the ocean.

I support the sanctuary as almost anywhere in oxnard you will see something about the ocean because it is one of our biggest food suppliers disregarding the fields in oxnard. I believe that the sanctuary should be able to help monitor the ecosystem and help keep up with the populations of the animals in the area that is being monitored. I want to be ensured that majority of the times the environment will be looked out for to make sure the food chain does not go terribly wrong

There can be opposing views, such as fishermen who do not agree with the boundaries of the sanctuary because they believe that they should be able to fish wherever they want and that the area should not be monitored. However, the sanctuary will benefit everyone by preserving our unique and irreplaceable coastal ecosystems and safeguarding thousands of years of Chumash cultural heritage by protecting sacred sites.

In conclusion, the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary will help preserve the unique and irreplaceable coastal ecosystems and safeguard thousands of years of Chumash cultural heritage by protecting sacred sites. It will also ensure that the environment is looked after to make sure the food chain does not go terribly wrong. Therefore, it is essential to support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary.

My name is Kaylie Nguyen, and I support the institution of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to offer a space of education, marine environmental protection, and preservation of the coast’s connections with the indigenous tribes of California.

I live in Oxnard, California and to me, the ocean is a place of recreation and community. When I go to the coast, I enjoy spending time with friends and family in the water or in the sand.

My name is Niki A. Gordillo and I support this swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats. 

I live in Oxnard, California and to me, the ocean is an impressive place since life is different in the ocean rather than the land and it’s very impressive how animals survive with/without oxygen and how the ecosystems work. When I go to the coast, I walk around the shorelines and just watch the waves come back in and out and I see the wildlife that’s out there (at least what I can see). 

The first reason why I support this is because the ocean is personally important to me. We depend on the ocean for recreation, for the Chumash’s spiritual beliefs, for the community connections, and for the economy. The second reason I want to protest this part of the ocean is because it is sacred land for the Chumash and we should respect the native-american land of the Chumash and their personal/spiritual beliefs. We should keep the oceans clean in general so the ecosystems could continue to thrive. The third reason is that the ocean is a beautiful place and should be respected and clean so animals can thrive and the underwater plants can continue to grow.

A sanctuary will be a very important part of ocean research and education for future generations instead of killing everything. 

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes a ban on oil/gas rigs because these rigs cause animals to die and it kills the animals' habitats in the process. If the oil/gas rigs aren’t gone, then there wouldn’t be any habitat for the animals to live in so they either die or migrate to another spot.

Dear Paul Michel,
My name is theresa brady and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.
I live in moorpark california and to me, the ocean is beautiful and a healing place to visit, as well as essential habitat to many species of acquatic life forms.

    • When I go to the coast, I watch the wildlife.
    • The ocean is personally important to me. We depend on the ocean for recreation, our spiritual well-being, and our community connections.
    • I want to protect this stretch of ocean so my community can continue to connect with and benefit from a clean, safe, and healthy ocean.  I especially care about migrating whales and the importance of point buchon for their survival.  It is also important to protect the coastal stretch of ocean north of point buchon as only the original  proposed boundary does. 
    • The ocean is beautiful and mysterious. There is so much we’ve learned from it and much more to be learned. A sanctuary will be an important part of ocean research and education for present and future generations.
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes: 
    • Biggest Possible Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension
    • Sanctuary Name: The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”
    • Tribal Collaborative Management: An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management.
    • Outreach & Education: Outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities
    • Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity
    • Ban Oil & Gas: A prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

I support the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary because I think it would be a nice accomplishment for the Indigenous people,because they've been wanting this for a while and I don’t think by them having their own sanctuary is a bad idea.They don’t want to cause any harm they just want to create this sanctuary because their ancestors have been maintaining this land and they want to carry on what their ancestors were trying to do.

My name is Jordyn Bauer and I was born and raised along California’s beautiful coast. I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary (CHNMS) with the Initial Boundary Alternative including Morro Bay and the Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I was born and raised in San Luis Obispo and frequently visit the coast to walk and boogie board. The ocean has always been a special place for me and my physical and emotional health. I studied environmental science in college and know the importance of protecting our oceans and all of the ecosystems within it. I would like to see future generations have the same opportunity to enjoy and benefit from our oceans. 

I support the designation of the CHNMS because it would help protect and keep our oceans and its species safe and healthy. I would like to see the initial boundary alternative including Morro Bay with the Gaviota Coast Extension. In addition, this is the first tribally led nominated sanctuary and would honor and respect tribal members who have stewarded the land and ocean for centuries. Please consider an equitable approach to include all Tribes in the Collaborative Management. 

I urge the Administration to designate the CHNMS to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

 
Sincerely,

Re: Comments on Draft Environmental Impact Statement for proposed Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, (Docket: NOAA-NOS-2021-0080)

I would like to thank NOAA for their role in the ongoing designation process of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary (CHNMS). Per NOAA: “No significant adverse impacts are expected under any of the alternative'' plans shown in the CHNMS Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS). Further, “Long term beneficial impacts are expected if the proposed action is implemented”. 

I whole-heartedly agree with the above assessments.

Also, per the Draft EIS, “The area contains unique and diverse ecosystems essential to the heritage of several tribal groups. The marine environment provides a special sense of place to coastal communities and visitors because of its significant historic, archaeological, cultural, aesthetic, and biological resources.” This statement is also true of many coastal areas around the United States (and the world). So, after formal recognition of the CHNMS, it will be vitally important for NOAA to show the federal government can be trusted to transparently carry out the sanctuary’s 11 action plans, and it’s up to local indigenous leaders and the public to work effectively with NOAA to measure, manage, and report meaningful protections of the CHNMS. The federal government has a brutal and destructive history when it comes to the rights of indigenous peoples, and a successful, transparent CHNMS could create beneficial opportunities to protect other ecosystems and people beyond the sanctuary’s boundaries.

Since a well-protected ocean is better for everyone, a larger well-protected area is also better. The CHNMS must include the waters off Cambria, Cayucos, and Morro Bay.I support the Initial Boundary alternative shown in the DEIS. Potential regulatory challenges, such as undersea cables coming onshore from the proposed Wind Energy Areas (WEA), can be permitted in a National Marine Sanctuary. I believe the additional oversight provided by the proposed CHNMS will be good for the offshore wind projects, and the sanctuary’s contributions to the offshore wind projects could help to improve clean energy projects elsewhere. 

Other possible actions will contribute to the sanctuary’s long term beneficial impacts: 
The DEIS mentions the City of Pismo Beach’s request for a 2 mile exclusion zone. I believe Pismo Beach leaders were previously misinformed about permissive exclusion zones within a sanctuary. The DEIS mention of an exclusion for Pismo’s pier is a more precise practice. Further, while studies on the Pismo Clam are ongoing, the proposed sanctuary might add meaningful support to helping the clam population rebound and Pismo Beach, like many other coastal areas in San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties, will significantly benefit from the sanctuary’s offerings.
The sanctuary could provide a meaningful contribution to the study of the impacts on upwelling downwind from wind energy projects. The sanctuary should begin baseline measurements for important elements within the sanctuary’s boundaries to be compared to findings after the WEA’s are installed. The waters off Cambria, Cayucos, and Morro Bay will be important contributors to these studies, only one of many reasons to include them within the sanctuary boundaries.

I had the great opportunity to share a friendship with Fred Collins, tribal leader of the Northern Chumash Tribal Council. Fred would speak about “Thrivability” and he would remind us how the failed concept of “Sustainability” is degrading the natural world around us. This is one lesson I learned from Fred: We must do better, and the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary should be managed for thrivability and nothing less.

Morro Bay is NOT an industrial commercial wharf...it is a community fishing and tourist destination town with many seals, sea otters, beautiful beaches,  sand dunes, open areas! 

The proposed Vistra battery storage facility should not be built as it does not fit in our sleepy quiet natural harbor town. 

I read you don't plan to include Morro Bay in the marine sanctuary because the planned underwater cables, offshore windmills etc make it ineligible.  Please be reminded that we dont have those windmills yet! We don't have the underwater cables yet! Many many hurdles must be cleared before they are built. Please don't put the cart ahead of the horse!

And, other than massive Vistra and some politicians,  many of we,  the citizens of Morro Bay, do not want our town to have the commercial battery storage plant. Please dont listen to the politicians as they come and go...they may have financial or other Non Environmental reasons why they want Morro Bay changed into the largest battery storage facility in the world...

Please do the right thing and INCLUDE Morro Bay in the Marine Sanctuary!!! By you doing the right thing and not being influenced by politicians and big money corporations like Vistra, you will help preserve Morro Bay as a natural gem for generations to come! 

Just remember that trends like windmills and battery storage come and go just like nuclear plants and oil...So, if voting to include MB in the Marine Sanctuary hinders or prohibits the battery storage plant, then, good, as that's what is needed!

I strongly support the creation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary.  

At the same time I vigorously oppose the creation of an Industrial Shipping Corridor cutting through the proposed Sanctuary.  

This last minute proposal strikes at the heart of the entire purpose of the marine sanctuary. In addition to being a sanctuary for animals and plants that live in the area, it will also serve as a wildlife corridor for animals traveling up and down the Pacific Coast.

Saying NO to the Industrial Shipping Corridor does not mean there will be no ships and heavy equipment…it means oversight of the development of the off-shore wind farm.  

It makes complete sense that there are strict governing rules that are rigorously enforced…versus a wild west approach to the offshore development.

YES to the creation of  Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary.

NO to the Industrial Shipping Corridor.

Thank you so much for your consideration.

Since the inception of the proposed Chumash Marine Sanctuary along the coast of California, the Salinan Tribe of Monterey and San Luis Obispo Counties (Salinan Tribe) has voiced our consistent and unwavering concerns to all governmental agencies and organizations involved in this process.  

At this point, the proposed name is not only historically inaccurate, but it also continues to perpetuate the false narrative that the central coast of California from the Channel Islands to the Monterey County border is the home to only one homogenized culture, the Chumash culture.  Educated historians and NOAA’s own research show that this is not the case.  California indigenous cultures throughout history have been a blend of overlapping languages and cultures.  As for Salinan culture, our culture is widely regarded as well traversed all throughout San Luis Obispo County and coastline.  

This is why we have consistently felt that a more appropriate name would be something that actually represents the historical accuracy of the known cultures represented in this proposed sanctuary.  

The gradual genocide of indigenous cultures, that began with the Spanish Mission Era along the coast of California in 1769, later pursued by the Mexican government with the theft of lands with their Mexican land grant policies from 1822 until 1850 and continuing after 1850 with California state and federal policies that both forced cultural genocide and funded the outright murder of the indigenous natives, continues today. 

Every generation claims they will right the wrongs of the past.  Yet every generation for the last 250 years has blindly repeated the sins of the past when it comes to native indigenous cultures.

Simply put, the Salinan culture deserves an equal seat at the table with equal respect, equal recognition, and equal dignity.  Anything less will not be acceptable to us as it will continue the narrative of systemic inequities that have permeated Spanish, Mexican, and American policy for over 250 years.  

This is why we continue to support an inclusive national marine sanctuary that includes a name that represent all indigenous cultures in the study area and simultaneously keeps the boundaries up to the Monterey Bay Marine Sanctuary throughout the northern part of San Luis Obispo County.  This simple proposal does more than rightfully preserve historical accuracy and cultural dignity.  It will also ensure the much needed protections of not only marine life, but of the indigenous cultures and traditions that are so important to everyone along the central coast.

From the onset of this proposed sanctuary, our solution has always been one that represents historical accuracy, equality, and respect for everyone.  And for this simple request, we have been marginalized, ridiculed, and routinely pushed aside.   

Our issue has never been with the Chumash culture and those who carry its legacy.  The Chumash culture is a vibrant story that needs to be preserved.  To those who are truly descended from this culture, we support you.  We are simply asking for the same respect in return.

For these reasons, the Salinan Tribe of San Luis Obispo and Monterey Counties will not support this marine sanctuary proposal until such time that both the name of the sanctuary is inclusionary representing historical accuracy, and that the boundaries equally protect all the lands up to the southern border of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary.

We stand resolved on our position.

My name is Raine Gardener-Félix, and I am writing to express my support for the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I live in San Luis Obispo, CA, and as someone born and raised on the Central Coast, the ocean is my home. Our local coastline supports a vibrant, diverse community of aquatic species, and getting to experience it has been one of the greatest joys of my life. In my professional life, I've had the privilege of assisting with biological monitoring and habitat restoration in Morro Bay, its estuary, and its tributaries. My work in these habitats has shown me firsthand the incredible interconnectedness of all life and how crucial marine sanctuaries are to supporting sustainable use of marine resources.

On a personal level, when life gets hard, the ocean is always able to bring me comfort. The constant, cyclical motion of the waves and the tides reminds me that whatever I'm feeling will pass. And the tide pools make me feel like a kid again, reminding me that even the smallest space on this planet is teeming with life if I just take the time to look.

I firmly support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary include the Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension to protect the greatest area possible. I also ask that this sanctuary honor this coastline's original Chumash stewards both in its name—""Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary""—and by including all Tribes in the Collaborative Management of the sanctuary. Finally, to preserve the integrity of the sanctuary, it is crucial that the Administration ban new oil and gas development within sanctuary boundaries.

The ocean is precious and irreplaceable. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to protect and preserve this one-of-a-kind place for generations to come.

Raine Gardener-Félix",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

I strongly support the designation the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary (CHNMS) with the largest boundary possible. 
Only by combining the Initial Boundary Alternative plus the Gaviota Extension (sub-alternative 5b) will you create a true sanctuary, providing contiguous protection between Monterey Bay and Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuaries. This area contains a rich, diverse marine environment, cultural resources including submerged historic Chumash villages, and shipwrecks, all of which are deserving of protection.

I do NOT support NOAA’s Alternatives 2, 3, or 4, which create a dangerous carve out for industrial uses that the Agency recognizes are incompatible with the purpose of sanctuary. These Alternatives imperil crucial marine habitat and species, including the endangered Peregrine falcons that nest on Morro Rock and the threatened Southern sea otters that find refuge in Morro Bay’s harbor. Morro Rock also holds great cultural significance for the Chumash people. It should be the heart of the new CNHMS. 

Anticipating future offshore wind development is a reason to extend protection to this vulnerable habitat, NOT to leave the area exposed to bypass the special use permit process. Rather than fast track industry, we must permanently protect the area from harmful activities like oil and gas development, seabed mining and dredging, and harmful polluting discharges to our waters.

Full connectivity with the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary is essential in maintaining a healthy ecosystem. Patchwork reserve boundaries and therefore patchwork marine management policies have the potential to fragment habitat. 

As the climate is changing, the last thing we need is more oil and gas development. I firmly oppose any new oil and gas development within sanctuary boundaries.

I strongly support tribal co-management of the reserve and believe that decision-making power must be shared between NOAA and all tribes that want to be involved. I also support including Morro Rock/Lisamu’ as part of the sanctuary because it is an extremely important cultural site.

I regularly hike at Montana de Oro, Point Sal, and other spots along the coast. Whenever I'm along the coast I look for whales, dolphins and other marine mammals. I would like to see these waters and ecosystems protected for future generations.

Sincerely,

Rachel Friesen",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

My name is Devin Wallace and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.
I live in Cayucos and the ocean is the reason I'm here. We are so fortunate to be close to the planet's lifeblood, so teeming with life.
Currently I volunteer doing water monitoring for the Morro Bay National Estuary Program. I want to protect this stretch of ocean so my community can continue to connect with and benefit from a clean, safe, and healthy ocean.
The ocean is beautiful and mysterious. There is so much we’ve learned from it and much more to be learned. A sanctuary will be an important part of ocean research and education for present and future generations.
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary holds to the initial boundary proposed with the Gaviota Coast Extension and the Rodriguez Seamount, which is essential to protect biodiversity.
 I realize that keeping the proposed boundaries will require some flexibility in considering the impacts of the windfarm infrastructure nearby, but to chop that section off seems extremely unwise, as the whole area needs protection at this critical point in our history.
I also believe the original proposed name, the Chumash Heritage Natonal Marine Sanctuary is the best choice, as the area contains so much Chumash history which must be preserved. Having the sanctuary under Tribal Collaborative Management will ensure that all tribes of the region have a voice. 
As a teacher I am particularly excited about the opportunities the sanctuary presents for Outreach & Education, includingresearch programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities.
One of the most important functions of the sanctuary will be to ban oil & gas development, which should have no place in these waters!
In summary, I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.
Sincerely,
Devin Wallace",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

Thank you for proceeding with the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary.

We urge the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary within the borders of the Initial Boundary Alternative as originally proposed, along with the Gaviota Coast Extension.

Including the waters between Point Buchon and Cambria will close a biodiversity protection gap along the California coast. This will protect the only eel grass bed in a 300-mile stretch of coast, many historic Chumash sites, numerous protected marine mammals and shorebirds, the area with the highest population of sea otters on the California coast, several State Marine Conservation Areas, the kelp forests of the Santa Barbara Channel, and rocky intertidal marine habitat considered to be one of the most diverse and abundant in the world.

Excluding any of these waters is unacceptable when multiple options are available that would allow for the permitting of the cables and infrastructure needed for the adjacent offshore wind area and would not require the permanent exclusion of 2,000 square miles of ocean from sanctuary protection. The National Marine Sanctuary Program should work closely with state and federal partners, OSW companies, Tribes, and community members to ensure off-shore wind is developed in the most environmentally and culturally responsible manner.

No other proposed alternative is adequate to this purpose. The Environmental Impact Statement acknowledges that all other alternatives would variously reduce the significant beneficial impacts on biological resources provided by the Initial Boundary Alternative to “moderate” or “minor” by comparison and increase the vulnerability of those resources to adverse impacts that the Initial Boundary Alternative would prohibit or mitigate. The alternatives that truncate the Initial Boundary Alternative would impact the many species that migrate through the unprotected areas, impacts that would go far beyond the wind farms' cable corridors.

We urge you to recognize your obligation to future generations and secure full protection for the irreplaceable ecosystem and cultural heritage of this vital marine region.",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/NOAA-NOS-2021-0080-2752/attachment_1.pdf","pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

Please find attached an Excel spreadsheet (.xlsx) containing the comments of 18,757 supporters of the National Audubon Society asking the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to designate Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary.

Many people submitted personalized comments, which can be found on the first worksheet; others sent the comments below: 
 
===================================
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, with boundaries that provide maximum protection from Cambria to Gaviota.  

With this sanctuary designation, we can create continuous ocean protection between the existing Monterey Bay and Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuaries.  

With the growing threats to our oceans and coasts, we cannot risk leaving this area open to harmful activities such as oil and gas extraction, seabed mining, and discharge into the ocean.  

Full protection will provide healthy habitats for seabirds and shorebirds that rely on this area. For example, 60% of the California Brown Pelican population is found within the proposed sanctuary. 

Morro Bay, an Important Bird Area, is one of the most significant wintering locations for migratory shorebirds on the Pacific Coast, with up to 20,000 birds feeding in the tidal mudflats. Sooty Shearwaters gather in the hundreds of thousands, relying on the open waters of the proposed sanctuary for food to make their annual migrations that span up to 40,000 miles.   

Offshore wind is essential in reaching our renewable energy goal, when wind turbines are sited in federal waters outside the proposed sanctuary and far from coastal resources and biologically rich state waters. I urge NOAA to work with the offshore wind industry and the state of California to site and permit only the necessary infrastructure, such as cables, to bring clean energy through the proposed sanctuary in locations that avoid or minimize ecological and cultural impacts.  

I urge NOAA to take bold actions and protect the largest area proposed for the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary.

We, as faith leaders, are enthralled to witness the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, the first Tribal-nominated national marine sanctuary, now has a proposed draft management plan. We, the undersigned, recognize the importance of Indigenous-led resilience efforts. The Northern Chumash and other tribes in the area have been caring for these waters successfully for millenia. It is of the utmost importance that the recommendations made by the Northern Chumash are incorporated into the final management plan of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary.

Our National Marine Sanctuaries need to be just that, sanctuaries. A space of care and comfort where all God’s creation can gather.  The ocean space nominated by the Northern Chumash Tribal Council to be a sanctuary, is just a formal acknowledgement of the care that the Northern Chumash and other tribes have given these waters for generations. We support the Northern Chumash in their continued care of God’s creation.

Specifically, we support the following recommendations of the Northern Chumash Tribal Council:

Sanctuary Boundary. It is vital that the sanctuary cover the largest possible contiguous boundaries. We support designation of the Initial Boundary Alternative with the Gaviota Coast Extension (Sub-Alt 5b), including the waters offshore Point Buchon, Morro Bay, Cayucos, and Cambria will close the California Central Coast’s biodiversity protection gap between Monterey Bay and Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuaries. This will protect the only eelgrass bed in a 300-mile stretch of coast; many historic Chumash sites, including Lisamu’ (Morro Rock); numerous protected marine mammals and shorebirds; the highest population of Southern sea otters on the California coast; several State Marine Conservation Areas; and the kelp forests and rocky intertidal habitats considered to be some of the most diverse and abundant in the world.

No other proposed sanctuary alternative is adequate. The Draft Environmental Impact Statement acknowledges that all other alternatives would reduce the significant beneficial effects on biological resources provided by the Initial Boundary Alternative. All other alternatives would increase the vulnerability of those resources to adverse impacts that the Initial Boundary Alternative would prohibit or mitigate.

We support the name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary” to honor the cultural history and stewardship of California Tribal Peoples, Equitable collaborative management must be open to all Tribal groups interested in participating, Outreach and Education, Rodriguez Seamount, Offshore Wind, and Water Quality.

We support equitable inclusion/representation of all Central Coast Tribes in the collaborative management of the sanctuary. By being equitable and inclusive, all sanctuary stakeholders will benefit from broad Indigenous input and TEK informing management. 

The sanctuary is an exceptional opportunity to advance the first Tribally-nominated national marine sanctuary designation in the United States, setting a precedent for elevating Indigenous perspectives, cultural values in ocean conservation, and collaborative management that includes all Central Coast Tribes. The designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary will be an unprecedented accomplishment, honoring the history and culture of Native Americans, the Chumash people, and their ancestors who inhabited this region for more than 10,000 years.

Each one of these asks is crucial to the continued successful sustenance and resilience of the ocean that will become the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. We thank you and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for recognizing the importance of following Indigenous led resilience efforts and, more specifically, for creating the final management plan based on the points made above.

This fall, pelicans were everywhere on the bay. Morro Bay also provides a calm place for residents and tourists to enjoy being on the water. On any given day, you can see kayaks, stand-up paddle boards, and dragon boats enjoying exercise and the wildlife. Leaving this area unprotected and allowing it to become an industrial corridor jeopardizes all of this.

It seems very wrong for the Biden Adminstration to exclude the original designated area from their new draft proposal of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I understand that it has to do with energy and the underwater cables that transport the energy from offshore wind-- but I think it violates the original spirit of the movement to exclude the Chumash people now from this process. 
I ask that the NOAA strongly reconsider their draft proposal to more accurately reflect the original proposal that they described when collaborating with the Chumash people. They have the best authority, knowledge and stewardship of that land and thus it should be reflected in this process. 
I really value this project, and the emphasis on environmental protection that the administration. Not only that-- I HIGHLY value the open collaboration the administration has placed with indigenous people (the Tongva in San Gabriel, etc). It has a been a tremendous step of healing that I do not take lightly. For this reason, I ask that the Administration, through the NOAA, rise to their own bar that they have set previously. I know you can do it, and thank you for what you've done in the past.

Please extend the sanctuary back to the original area proposed by the Chumash people, it is fundamentally the right thing to do.

I write to support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I live in Campbell, California and frequently visit the coastal region within the proposed National Marine Sanctuary.  To me, the ocean contains the most important habitats to support life on earth and the emotional wellbeing of residents and visitors of this area.  Additionally, the following points are critical:
•	Habitats in the ocean are equipped to reduce the amount of carbon in the atmosphere, and when protected can be additionally beneficial.
•	With climate change, the sensitive habitats in the ocean need additional protections.
•	Many people that live in or visit California depend on the ocean for recreation, spiritual well-being, community connections, and economic health.
•	I want to protect this stretch of ocean so the community can continue to connect with and benefit from a clean, safe, and healthy ocean.
•	The ocean is beautiful and mysterious. There is so much we’ve learned from it and much more to be learned. A sanctuary will be an important part of ocean research and education for present and future generations.
•	Contiguous protections in the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension are necessary to protect migrating species, such as whales and dolphins.
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes: 
•	Biggest Possible Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension
•	Sanctuary Name: The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”
•	Tribal Collaborative Management: An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management.
•	Outreach & Education: Outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities
•	Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity
•	Ban Oil & Gas: A prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

A Marine Sanctuary designation will allow for the safe and timely evaluation of potential impacts of floating offshore wind at this scale and allow for a permitting process that meets the high standard an area with such biodiversity and ecological preservation deserves to have. Without a designated protection of the area, the local marine habitats, coastal economies, and utility ratepayers risk bearing the burden of overambitious and costly infrastructure for the greater benefit of major load centers in the State. Instead, please reconsider a Marine Sanctuary designation and offer a schedule of the offshore wind that accurately accounts for the preservation of local environments and economies.

My name is Sylvia, I’m a 34-year old novelist and wildlife tracker. I was born and raised in Mill Valley, California and am devoted to our beautiful land and waters, and to traditions of the indigenous people of this state. I grew up going regularly to the beaches of the Point Reyes Peninsula, a National Seashore, and those memories are still guiding lights for me in my life. The ocean is personally my place of sanctuary and inspiration; a constant mystery that heals and uplifts and awes me.

My name is Rev. Dr. Frances Wattman Rosenau. I am a faith leader involved in my community, I am a parent and advocate for our planet. I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I have recently had the blessing of following my 11 year old son's lead to take up scuba diving. He loves the ocean, and I am in awe of his connection to our planet, our local eco systems, and the wildlife that lives just off our coast. I live in Culver City, but this summer we spent a lot of time in the Channel Islands hiking, snorkeling, and scuba diving. I learned more about the Chumash connection to that site and the way Santa Cruz particularly, almost saw several unique species go extinct. Preservation of both the ecology and the heritage was so crucial in designating the national park and protected areas of the surrounding ocean.

What's especially important to me is following the lead of indigenous people and tribes.  The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary” is imperative. Conservation is not a new fad but one that my religious forefathers did not fully appreciate when they came to California. It is time to right the wrongs of the past through designated this protected area - with the initial boundary alternative - to preserve the tribal connection to these waters and coastline. 

This is a great opportunity to have more education of Traditional Ecological Knowledge and bring that knowledge to local under-served communities. This would also redress some of the harm done in the past by exploitative practices both towards people and towards the ecology.
    
And, of course, we need to prohibit any new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries

I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures. A sustainable relationship to the waters is possible and the time is now.

Conserving our oceans is key to the future of countless species, including humanity. This measure would stop the specter of offshore oil drilling, allowing us to do the key research needed to know what our effect on the things living there may be. In addition, the designation of this sanctuary is projected to create jobs, which is always a good thing for the economy and society. And finally, perhaps most importantly, by designating this sanctuary and consulting with the Chumash people while doing so, this act will allow indigenous Californians to finally have some say over the stewardship of their historical lands. This will also allow everyone to benefit from indigenous knowledge when it comes to conservation stewardship, hopefully creating a more effective plan for management overall.

I spent countless hours going out of Albion in my kayak, diving for abalone, spearing fish, and enjoying the rich undersea garden that was here - giant sea stars, nudibranchs, iridescent kelp, seals, fish, and so much more. I totally support the proposed Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, with the largest possible boundary. I think there should be a ban on new oil and gas development in the Sanctuary area. I'm concerned about the proposed wind farm in this area. It's too close to shore and too big. I'm in favor of wind farms but I think this one could be located in a less biodiverse area. 
I hope you will collaborate with the Chumash and other local tribes to make this Marine Sanctuary the biggest and best it can be.
Thank you,
Dobie Dolphin

I write in support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. 

My husband and I have lived on the Central Coast for 25 years. I am a sailor, paddler, scuba diver, bird watcher. In short -  I have first hand knowledge of the area. But I don’t ask for the sanctuary designation for my own use, but so that it will be preserved in perpetuity. We do not know what secrets the sea hold for us, but we do know that we are capable of grave damage to the natural environment unless we create boundaries and laws to control our actions.

I ask that this sanctuary include:

• The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension.
• Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity.
• Ban Oil & Gas: A prohibition on new oil and gas development within sanctuary boundaries.

I do support exploration into development of wind energy solutions. However, I don't believe it is necessary to reduce the proposed NMS because this might be a possibility in the future. We should be able to find a way to develop wind in a manner compatible with the values of a marine sanctuary.

Thank you for your consideration.

I want to applaud the Chumash bands throughout the Central Coast for proposing the Sanctuary and working so hard towards federal designation. I also want to applaud NOAA for their collective analysis and consideration of the many factors and issues involved in their recommendation. I am interested in protecting as much of the California coast as possible and I fully support the original designation as proposed by the Northern Chumash Tribal Council. 
I have read the revised designation proposed by NOAA and understand the reasons and rationale for reducing the protected coastline to allow for the development of undersea cables for off-shore energy development between Morro Bay and Monterey Bay. I have no technical background to asses the needs and impact of off-shore energy development but I would hope that some way could be found to develop wind energy in a way that allows for minimal environmental impact and protects more of the coastline as proposed by NOAA. 
It is challenging to balance the protection of coastline and marine life with the need for alternative energy sources. However, we need the ocean to be protected and the more we develop parts or sections of it, the higher the risk of more serious environmental impacts. The ocean is an eco system that can't be organized into compartments and ocean is not the only source for wind energy. I urge you to reconsider the NOAA designation and adopt the designation as originally proposed by the Chumash. Thank you. ",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

My name is Erin Naegle, and am the co-founder of the Gold Country Bat Project, and I support whole heartedly the  designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.
This area of the coast is critical habit to so many species, as humans that have disrupted and destroyed habitat in so many places, providing this protected marine corridor is the very least we can do. And I am so very grateful for the designation of the Marine Sanctuary, thank you for all of your work and effort in this process. I also strongly plead that the entire Initial Boundary Alternative be used when making the sanctuary.
I live in Cambria CA, and have come to love this coast and ocean. My wife and I moved here because of the wild coast. Listening to the otters crack open shells and watching the pelicans dive for their lunch is heartening. There are places where life continues to be in abundance. This needs our thoughtful and committed protection.  
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes the biggest possible boundary and a prohibition on new oil and gas development. I also ask that any windfarm development be done mindfully, and minimize impacts on birds, bats, marine mammals, and the great variety of fish. Wind turbines can be regulated so that they are not running during migrations or when bats are active. 
Furthermore, the protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity. It is undoubtedly home to species heretofore undocumented. Let us protect it rather than alter the habitat.

The brown Pelicans fly up and down the coast, constantly it seems in the fall.  I love the ocean and the fresh air, and the amazing un-obscured sunsets.
My points for this coment letter 
1.  Sanctuary Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension Sanctuary
The contiguous nature of the sanctuaries along the California coast are is of the upmost importantce - creating a cotinuous protected marine wildlife corridor.  And so important to include the bulge - go out all the way to the edge of the continental shelf.  The marine life depends on the upwelling that happens there.
Also important to me is science - my daughter studies bats, and I am quite concerned that it sounds like very little research has been done offshore to understand the migration of insects, bats, and birds and how the proposed windfarms may effect them.  And I am very concerned about floating windfarms.  In my lifetime I have seen so many incidents of unintended negitive environmental consequences as a result of not doing proper science and studies before trying to create a new way of doing something.   Often slow and steady wins the race and fast and furious ends up upside down in the bleachers. 
I do not want to see any more development of oil and gas along the coast and certainly not in the NMSs.  And no sea floor mining.  My daughter told me about the permits for kelp harvesting and it seems like with all the stressors we are adding  to the ocean, we should really  think hard about our actions. 
Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount - This needs to be a priority to protect, include in the new sanctuary, and have researchers begin to understand what is living there.  I have heard about the Davidson Sea Mound in Monterey Bay NMS (my daughter told me about all the new species that have been discovered there) these sea mounds are unique habitat -  Rodriguez sea mound needs to be in the sanctuary boundaries.   I would also like to see an education center for the school children and for tourists and locals.   We love going to the Monterey Bay Aquarium and always learn so much.  It would be nice to have a simpler, smaller version of that - perhaps in Morrow Bay area.
Thank you for reading my thoughts on the matter.
These are very important decisions you are making.  To protect the earth and it's inhabitants is what we are all called to do.  I wish we were doing a better job of it.   Please let your decisions move us towards better stewardship of the marine environment along the California Coast.

My name is Lynn ""Jeong"" Stransky, and I strongly support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats. This move would not only protect wildlife, but it would be a small step towards reparations.

I live in Los Angeles, CA and to me, the ocean is one of our most precious landscapes and resources, and it must be protected. We know that Indigenous people have an intimate relationship with the land, and they will care for it better than any industrialized nation ever could. Protecting this area would do so much to protect wildlife!

Please, I urge you to support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary be as large as possible, named the ""Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary,"" managed through tribal collaborative management, and encompass the Rodriguez Seamount too. I also demand that you prohibit new oil and gas development within sanctuary boundaries. There are so many incredible renewable energy sources that it is embarrassing to use anything else.

Dear NOAA, 
As someone who lives on Monterey Bay in Santa Cruz CA, close to your offices there, I stand with the Chumash requests for the following important measures to truly protect the CHNMS. Having the Chumash themselves officially involved in stewarding and planning for its protection is of paramount importance. I volunteer with the Amah Mutsun, who have a State of California grant to protect part of our amazing coastline. I can see the dignity and care with which the tribal members discharge their responsibilities. 
Biggest Possible Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension
Sanctuary Name: The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”
Tribal Collaborative Management: An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management.
Outreach & Education: Outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities
Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity
Ban Oil & Gas: A prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries.

Sincerely, DR, Central Coast CA, PADI certified scuba diver

I just returned from a vacation in honor of my birthday in San Luis Obispo County (I am a resident of Ventura County, but go up north as much as possible to the Central Coast, most frequently to Santa Barbara). It was a magical weekend and highlights include climbing Black Hill and admiring the entire Morro Bay coastline, as well as a sunset at the beach at Morro Rock, with horses on the beach in the distance. This area inspires awe with its overwhelming beauty. Adding to the value of natural beauty is the history of the region as sacred land to the Chumash people. I have great respect for the history and ecology, and feel strongly all should be done to preserve this precious natural area. On my last trip to the region, I also enjoyed a stunning sunset over Montana de Oro. The gifts of the region are for locals and tourists alike, and the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary protects it for generations to come. I hope to experience the same pristine beauty for many more vacations, and the proposed rule protects a vulnerable environment, already struggling from Climate Change. Let's do the least we can do and make the Chumash Heritage Sanctuary a reality! Thank you, Lauri Kamiel",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

This is a treasure that we have a responsibility to protect. Our other California marine sanctuaries have been shown to be economically and ecologically beneficial to our state, country and planet. Let's continue to be good stewards.

I support the establishment of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary using the largest possible contiguous sanctuary boundaries, as shown in the Initial Boundary Alternative combined with the Gaviota Coast Extension (Sub-Alternative 5b). I think it's vitally important to link our marine sanctuaries. I am also strongly in favor of a plan that allows for the best use of wind power off coastline.  I support any needed permits need to create the wind farm and believe this  can be created with greater oversight than if we left out that part of the coast of Morro Bay up to San Simeon.

Thank you for giving the public comments consideration.

Last semester, earlier this year, I actually interned at the MBNMS Sanctuary Exploration Center in Santa Cruz. Within this internship I was tasked with aiding on field trips, to teach kids the importance of keeping our beaches and oceans clean, the health of our kelp forests, testing of oceanography, and much more. This internship taught me a lot of things I hadn't known before. I was learning, along with the kids, what a sanctuary was and why it was important. As we are dealing with increasing ocean temperatures, we are noticing negative effects that come with it. Which is why it is important to have a protected area that we are able to test and monitor; for both improvements or declines. A designated sanctuary will allow for regulations to keep everything inside safe and help diminish the wicked problems of pollution of all forms (fossil fuels, noise, light, trash, etc.). Traveling the coast of California from north down to south, there are clear differences in the ocean where you can tell which portion has regulations against pollution and which beaches don't. Protection of the ocean isn't only beneficial to aquatic organisms, but to the health of humans as well. If fish are eating microplastics, and we eat fish, we are eating microplastics too. Everything in this world is intertwined, a domino effect, one small thing can eventually cause catastrophe to all things, until nothing is habitable (talking on worst case scenario but still a likely possibility we’re headed towards). It takes small acts to ruin something, but it can take small acts to improve something as well. Which to some adding a sanctuary may seem useless but it’s not. Just like when the Monterey Bay National Marine Santuary was established after a large oil spill, we started seeing ocean animals populations increase again. Also with the otter populations, otters are mainly found along the west coast due to these protection (no longer allowed to hunt for them) and they are still slowly climbing out of their almost extinct phase. There is a lot to be fixed in this world, and establishing this sanctuary is one small step that will help towards a larger goal.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

My name is Nicholas Cecchi from Sacramento, California, and I want to express my support for this management plan (naming, protection, and area). It so happens I have stumbled upon this plan after a full day of thinking about my university's (Sacramento State University) indigenous land acknowledgement. This led me to read about the California native American genocide of the 1800s, and the newly appointed California truth and healing council. The past is out of reach, but we can both affect the future and appreciate the humanity that is around us here in the present. It is with that ethos/background that tribal co-management and naming of this sanctuary appeal to me, as well as the sanctuary status itself.

Furthermore, being this area of coastline has had a past with oil spills/leaks (eg: Avila beach) and will seemingly continue to feel non-native developmental pressures (ie: housing sprawl), this in my opinion lends the area as a good candidate for as much marine protection (and it's biodiverse areas like Rodriguez Seamount) as possible.

The California state government have long iterated energy commitments to the public that will decrease the reliance of fossil fuel sources as much as possible: any comment contrary to this sanctuary plan presented at the federal level would not be supportive, representative, or substantiated of the needs or goals at the local level. This is an especially important point of relevance in this plan as the tribal population concerned is concentrated right at this sanctuary area and nowhere else in the nation.

I hope this hastily written comment has provided some meaningful input. Thank you for reading,

Dear Paul Michel,

My name is Christian Fernandez and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I live in Watsonville, CA and to me, the ocean is Vital to myself and my community around me. 
When I go to the coast, I go with my friends, family, and dog. We all enjoy making memories together, watching the sunsets, feeling the breeze, and sharing smores together on summer nights.
I enjoy the sounds of the waves as they provide me with a sense of serenity, watching wildlife, and the beauty of mother nature.
The ocean is personally important to me. We depend on the ocean for recreation, spiritual well-being, community connections, and economic health.
I want to protect this stretch of ocean so my community can continue to connect with and benefit from a clean, safe, and healthy ocean.
The ocean is both gorgeous and fascinating.  We've obtained a tremendous amount of knowledge from it, and there's still a lot more to discover. A marine sanctuary will be essential in ocean research and education for current and future generations.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes: 
Biggest Possible Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension
Sanctuary Name: The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary” to recognize people that have lived on this coast since time immemorial, by Western estimates over 10,000 years and protect the heritage of the Chumash.
Tribal Collaborative Management: An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management. To support the creation of a Tribal Sanctuary Advisory Council made up of all interested local Tribal groups as well as a NOAA Tribal Liaison.
Outreach & Education: Outreach, education, and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities. We could include educational programs and efforts to protect and maintain historically significant sites.
Scientific Research: Marine sanctuaries frequently provide opportunities for scientific research to better understand and monitor marine ecosystems. This research can help to inform conservation efforts and increase our understanding of marine life.
Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity because it provides a critical habitat for an extremely diverse and abundant array of marine life.
Ban Oil & Gas: A prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries
Conservation of Marine Ecosystems: To protect and conserve marine ecosystems, such as coral reefs, kelp forests, seafloor habitats, and various species that live in these areas. Involves regulations that prevent damage to at-risk habitats, such as restrictions on fishing, anchoring, or other potentially harmful activities.
Recreational Opportunities: We may allow for acceptable recreational activities such as diving, snorkeling, boating, and wildlife watching, as long as they are done responsibly.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.
 
Sincerely,

Christian Fernandez

My name is Margaret Crockett, I do not speak for Pacific Wildlife Care, but I am a Past President of that organization, and current supporter of theirs, as such I support all sorts of environmental issues in San Luis Obispo County in which I have lived for over 17 years. I absolutely support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.
I live in San Luis Obispo and our Pacific Ocean which is within a few miles of me on 180 degrees land and sea around me.

I happened to be at a Pacific Wildlife Care event on Sunday October 22, 2023 and there met a lawyer who has been working on the National Marine Sanctuary.  I told her that I already favored the inclusion of the whole area off our coast, but learned from her that a whole swath of the coast from Cambria down to Morro Bay is being considered as dropped from the Santuary, even more than I had thought.  I asked why, of course. She told me because of the potential for the wind farm which may or may not even be built in our area.

I learned from her that if it even is approved to be built it will likely be 10 years from now, and there are questions about how likely it is given the amount of wind we receive.  Although the argument is often given that our site is perfect for a wind farm because of the electrical infrastructure we have in Morro Bay and off of Diablo Canyon.  The technology in these locations is decades old, very likely way too antiquated to be equal to the task.  A cable might be needed, ok this is far off in time, and the Chumash people have said over and over that they are willing to collaborate with any wind farm organizations which are engaged, if they ever are.  In the meantime, we need to connect the whole Pacific Coast between the Monterey Marine Sanctuary and the Channel Islands Marine Sanctuary.  Anything less is a very very sad partial solution to the protection our coast requires!

I want to protect this stretch of ocean so my community can continue to connect with and benefit from a clean, safe, and healthy ocean.
The ocean is beautiful and mysterious. There is so much we’ve learned from it and much more to be learned. A sanctuary will be an important part of ocean research and education for present and future generations.
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes:

I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.  To do something less than all this would be a pitiful substitute from the whole solution we need in this area.

Re: NOAA–NOS–2021–0080

Dear Mr. Michel,

Environment California is a non-profit environmental advocacy group with one mission: to build a greener, healthier world. Along with our national partner, Environment America, we are submitting 11,594 public comments on behalf of our members and followers. 

Our organizations wholeheartedly support the creation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. From warming waters to threatened species to pollution from oil drilling and more, our oceans are in need of additional conservation efforts. Sanctuaries and marine monuments can play an important role in providing healthier marine habitats and healthier oceans altogether. 

The proposed Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary encompasses a diverse range of ecosystems teeming with marine life. Its habitats include coral reefs, kelp forests, coastal wetlands and more. It’s a feeding stop for migratory marine mammals and provides a home for 25 threatened or endangered species, including southern sea otters, leatherback sea turtles and humpback whales. Establishing the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary will protect the area from significant threats, including offshore oil and gas drilling, which can have devastating impacts on marine life, as evidenced by the 2021 oil spill off the coast of Orange County. 

The area also holds deep cultural significance to the Chumash people and is the first tribally nominated national marine sanctuary.

As you finalize the plan, we urge your agency to choose the most extensive and continuous sanctuary boundaries, as outlined in the Initial Boundary Alternative combined with the Gaviota Coast Extension (Sub-Alternative 5b). This would bridge the unprotected gap between the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary to the north and the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary to the south, ensuring a connected stretch of coastline where oil drilling is prohibited, safeguarding these critical ecosystems. 

We understand that NOAA may have reduced the size of the sanctuary to accommodate offshore wind. Know that we write this letter as supporters of offshore wind. There’s no reason why responsibly placed offshore wind support infrastructure cannot coexist with a sanctuary. 

Additionally, we support the creation of a Research Activity Panel (RAP) with a designated NOAA Research Coordinator, similar to the structure in the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. This will result in a comprehensive understanding of the marine environment.

Here is the specific language of the public comment that our 11,594 members and followers signed: 


Thank you for your swift action to create the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. The region off the California coast is home to sea otters, kelp forests, and deep sea areas that are still unexplored.

We support Sub-Alternative 5b; the Initial Boundary Alternative combined with the Gaviota Coast Extension, the original boundary proposed by the Northern Chumash Tribe. This is the only proposal to create a contiguous series of sanctuaries from Monterey Bay to the Channel Islands.

It is vital that this incredibly biodiverse region receives permanent protection from oil drilling and mining as well as the opportunity for additional resources to manage and protect this ocean life.

By establishing the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the most extensive boundaries, NOAA will take the next step towards safeguarding California’s incredible ocean life for decades to come. 

Sincerely,

I have been telling people what a gracious and kind man I have seen you to be in the Grover Beach and San Luis Obispo public events.  My love for the ocean runs deep; two granddaughters are studying to be marine conservationists, I am a retired earth science teacher, and I lead a peace and earth care group for a local Friends (Quaker) meeting.  My personal goal these last two months has been to educate and activate 100 people about the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary.  The positive energy I have seen has gratified me.  The Central Coast Friends Meeting approved a minute in support unanimously.  I have tried to emphasize that NOAA was pressured by BOEM and the State of California to delete the area from Morro Bay to Cambria to make it easier for the projected wind farm to lay cables, but these cables need to have permits or they could harm sea life and the ocean floor inadvertantly.  I am certain that with all our voices begging NOAA to restore the initial boundaries to include Morro Bay to Cambria that NOAA will be able to stand up for the initial sanctuary boundaries.  I have also praised NOAA's addition of the Gaviota coast extension which shows sensitivity to tribal requests.  I am confident that you will honor the endless hours and effort of the Northern Chumash and designate the area they proposed.  Thank you so much.

We also need to strengthen scientific research and monitoring in MPAs/sanctuaries along with developing more recreational access that isn’t fishing - examples include small vessel ramps/hoists, scuba diving access, bird/whale watching, and tide pooling.

My name is Brooke L. Hemming and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I am a native Californian, currently living in Durham, North Carolina.  To me, the California coastline is my spiritual home and a refuge that sustained me during my undergraduate and doctoral studies at UC Berkeley and Stanford University.  During those years, I learned about the critical role our oceans play in the stability of Earth's climate system as well as global ecosystems.  When life in the lab became overwhelming, I would get in my car and drive out to Monterey Bay and the surrounding coastal areas to remind myself of why I wanted to do work in environmental science and protection.  When I retire from my current civil service job, I hope to return to the area to live out the remainder of my life. 

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes:

My name is Mark Strovink and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I live in Walnut Creek, CA and to me, the ocean is a magical place to visit, as I did last week. Our group completed three hikes along the coast near Cambria, of 8, 8, and 4 miles.

I want to protect this stretch of ocean so citizens can continue to connect with and benefit from a clean, safe, and healthy ocean.

I am writing in strong support of the immediate designation of the entire proposed Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, specifically one that excludes the NOAA proposed off shore wind energy project. 

I live in Novato California and actively involve myself in the Grater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary through my Beach Watch volunteer role. In this role I’ve learned so much about the importance of Marine Sanctuaries in general in terms of stewardship and education as well as the value they provide in protecting what is one of the most biologically diverse spots on earth. 

Having the addition of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary would make California a model for Marine Sanctuary designation, situating the current Cordell Bank, the Greater Farallones, and the Channel Islands Sanctuaries in one long close to interconnected whole. What a magnificent and positive accomplishment that would be. 

I want to reiterate my support for the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, one that includes tribal collaboration, the largest possible boundary (the initial boundary alternative with the Gaviota Coast extension), and a prohibition on new oil and gas development. Again, I do not support the NOAA proposed off shore wind energy project and it’s resulting direct negative impact on the marine ecosystem structures and functions. 

I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary in order to honor our commitment as stewards of our precious California Eastern Pacific marine ecosystem.

I am writing in vigorous support of designating the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I was born and raised in Santa Barbara.  Not without some reluctance I left the area at age 23 to pursue a Ph.D. in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. I now live in San Diego, CA--a close second, but not Santa Barbara.  I return to the central coat often.  I have been fortunate to travel to many other beautiful places as well.  None however captivate my heart and mind like the central coast of California.  I have heard many, many visitors say so as well.  When I learned today of the push to create the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary I was absolutely thrilled.  This is an amazing opportunity to protect a beautiful place in a way that the United States of America has done so well with many of its public lands.  Other countries look up to the US for this, and we certainly see the thrill in the faces of tourists when they see our public lands.  We must continue to protect our land and ocean. This is a fight that must be waged every day by every generation in the face of society's temptation for unmitigated extraction of resources from our planet.  There is a place for extraction of needed resources, but the central coast of California is not that place.  It is pristine in a way that will not come back in any reasonable time frame if we let the market determine how the land and sea is used.  I urge you in the unique role of being a government agency to be a proper steward of the land and sea by protecting this beautiful place for the long term.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes: 

Biggest Possible Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension
Sanctuary Name: The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”
Tribal Collaborative Management: An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management.
Outreach & Education: Outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities
Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity
Ban Oil & Gas: A prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

I want to protect this stretch of ocean so my community can continue to connect with and benefit from a clean, safe, and healthy ocean.
The ocean is beautiful and mysterious. There is so much we’ve learned from it and much more to be learned. A sanctuary will be an important part of ocean research and education for present and future generations.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes: 

Biggest Possible Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension
Sanctuary Name: The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”
Tribal Collaborative Management: An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management.
Outreach & Education: Outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities
Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity
Ban Oil & Gas: A prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

I live in Morro Bay, CA and to me, the ocean is paramount to my well being as well as the well being of my community. The ocean provides recreation (for me kayaking, whale watching and beachcombing) and spiritual solace as well as economic vitality to Morro Bay. Protecting the ocean protects life in Morro Bay.
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes the area from Cambria to Morro Bay as well as the Gaviota Extension. To exclude this area would be a travesty. I believe that management should include collaboration with all local tribals. I believe that the proposed wind farm and the marine sanctuary can coexist. The wind farm should not exclude Morro Bay from the sanctuary boundaries. Like national forests, responsible economic use within the boundaries is possible. But, all new oil and gas development should be banned.

The creation of the marine sanctuary will buffer the effects of the Climate Crisis, effectively maintaining the ecological resistance of the area. 
	In addition, the prohibition of activities maintains two types, allowing the potential for offshore development. The inclusion of these activity prohibitions creates an avenue for continual growth, which maintains the economic interests of the State and private sector.

My name is Diana Madden and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.
I live in San Francisco, CA and to me, the ocean is a source of awe and comfort.
I have had the pleasure of visiting all of this coastline, some parts, such as Morro Bay and Cayucas, many times.  I had the joy of introducing my children, now great lovers of nature, the sea and the beach, to cave kayaking in these very waters. One of the favorite books of their childhood told the adventures of an orphaned sea otter who played with the seals of the central coast, and pointing out to them the locations where “Phokey” had frolicked was always a highlight on our family trips to the central coast.
The ocean is personally important to me. We depend on the ocean. It connects us with the cycles of nature, our fellow inhabitants of the earth and gives me spiritual well-being.  The tourism generated by recreational opportunities, glorious scenery and properly managed fisheries, contribute to our economic health while maintaining the possibility that our grandchildren will be able to enjoy and learn from this special place.
. These waters flow and touch every continent and effect ecosystems across the globe, we, as citizens of the USA and the globe, must take our stewardship seriously and preserve all of this treasure for future generations.
I want to protect this stretch of ocean so my community can continue to connect with and benefit from a clean, safe, and healthy ocean.
The ocean is beautiful and mysterious. There is so much we’ve learned from it and much more to be learned. A sanctuary will be an important part of ocean research and education for present and future generations.

When my daughter-in- law first visited Los Osos and Morro Bay, her comment was, ""I didn't know that a place like this still existed in California"".  She was raised in San Diego.  

I was raised in Carpinteria, and spent my childhood exploring the coast and streams that at that time were filled with abalone, pismo clams, and teaming with fish we caught off the Santa Barbara pier.  The 1969 oil spill and channelization of the creeks following the 1969 flooding by the army corp of engineers devastated the ecosystems that I treasured, and set me on a lifelong journey to do what I could to stop the devastation.  The factors that affected these species are complex, and not well understood.  I observed the changes from my childhood perspective.  One year you could reach your hand into the sand and pull out a pismo clam.  After 1969--I never again found a clam.  For the past 20 years, I have worked with conservation groups, state and tribal biologists, and individuals to conserve open space for endangered species (primarily salmon) with the Washington State Department of Fish & Wildlife and Snohomish County.  The impact of these conservation efforts have been vital, but fall far short of what should be done, what could be done.  In my experience, the tribal conservation efforts are often the key element in successful conservation efforts.  In my experience, the tribal focus and dedication exceeds that of federal, state and local jurisdictions because their focus and dedication and commitment to conservation efforts is unwavering.  I understand and empathize with the need to balance clean energy with conservation in California.  Taking a step back in decommissioning Diablo Canyon was such a personal blow to me I can hardly contain my grief.  But there has to be another way.  I ask you--as a local business owner and individual who has dedicated her life to habitat conservation.  Please let the Chumash lead the decision-making process.  

The 1969 flood devastated our family's avocado ranch in Carpinteria.  The trauma of that loss has haunted our family since then.  When I think about that loss, I think about the losses that the indigenous people have endured.  When I witness the Chumash rise from these losses and step up to conserve what still exists, it gives me hope.  I fully support their efforts, and lend my voice to their voices.  Please listen to them.  They have the deepest connection to this place that we all cherish.  We need to slow down and listen.  Our grandchildren will thank us for that.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

My name is Alyssa Medrano. I am in the 10th grade and I attend Pacifica High School in Oxnard, CA. I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.


I love spending time at the beach and visiting different parts of my state’s coast. I travel along the coast with my family to make new memories and enjoy the presence of marine life. It’s traditional to visit the coast, and I would love to have this sanctuary be extended to protect wildlife as well as preserve culture for others’ to enjoy. In protecting this region of land, I know that marine life would thrive and be protected so that my kids in the future could see this and enjoy it as much as I would.

The main reason that I support the designation of the sanctuary is because I believe that in preserving this area, people, as well as marine life would offer protection and connection with the indigenous groups of California. Students, as well as visitors of the area, would learn much of the Chumash culture when presented with the option of visiting. By reserving this ocean area, marine life would be protected by invasive species. If you think about it, protecting marine life is also protecting the species and further giving them more freedom to live free. With this preserved sanctuary, we will have a new space to learn about the culture of the Chumash and marine life. New and healthy perspectives of this region would be culturally engaging for me to visit the Sanctuary and further support it. On the other hand, people believe the area should be preserved for wind turbines for renewable energy. Yet, this plantation of wind turbines could be done in another area, and does not necessarily share culture or protection of marine life to California citizens. All in all, we should all support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary.

Sincerely,

Alyssa Medrano",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

My name is Dulce Avin and I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary because I think the protection and preservation of the Chumash Sanctuary would benefit marine life. The  Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary is being proposed to preserve marine life and culture along 156 miles of the California coastline. 

I live in Oxnard, California, right next to the coast. I enjoy spending time at the beach with family and friends. I have grown a relationship with the beach and care about all marine life that have previously been disrupted. I would like for the ocean to continue being a safe environment for sea life. The benefit of this sanctuary is it will prevent oil production in this area. Acoustic testing will also be prohibited. 

On the opposing side people believe this area should be preserved for the wind turbines and oil consumption, but these have both proved to be harmful to the environment. The Chumash sanctuary will expand California’s tourist-based economy and provide over 600 new jobs. With the sanctuary, we will all have something to learn and research about the culture of the Chumash. While protecting our beautiful ocean and marine life sceneries.

Hello, my name is Esmeralda Lopez. I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. 

I’m currently living in Oxnard, CA near the area that is being suggested for designation. When I visit the beach it’s usually with family or for volunteer work with my club. It’s very nice hanging out with groups of people I love doing whatever it is that we are doing, from walking around to playing with the sand/water or cleaning up and having fun. Based on my experience when I've done beach cleanups I usually find trash but on rare occasions I’ve also seen/found a dead sea lion. Since this coast has been a host to offshore oil and gas development for over many years along with the designated area that is being proposed as a national marine sanctuary. The oil spills that have occurred have caused significant environmental harm. These oil spills could lead to other animals (such as the dead sea lion I saw) deaths, if no action is brought to provide a better living environment for the marine life that live there. Others may disagree and would rather have something else built in this location but THIS project will greatly help not only the environment but also the relationship between the natives and scientists that will be working together towards this goal. I fully support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. 


Sincerely,

All NOAA and western natural resource management seems to know how to do is privatize the fish in the sea, cut off huge swaths of the ocean for 20 years, only to reopen it and cut off the opposite swath, all the while putting out press releases touting the supposed miracle of the groundfish recovery. Salmon redds are intentionally dewatered, the fry boiled in their natal streams. Global warming goes unaddressed; the oil must flow. We are forced to listen to unceasing drivel from the likes of Wild Fish Conservation Network or Oceana in our fisheries management meetings. I would rather hear what the Chumash have to say and welcome their co-management of the proposed sanctuary. I think they have a valuable contribution to bring.

My name is Jayden Baldueza, and I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I support it because I believe that all the reasons and actions this Sanctuary has are perfectly fine with me. It helps the local animals like otters. I, as a person, really love otters, their swimming, smiles, and fur are all so great. So when I saw that the NOAA helps sea life including otters, I knew I had to support it.

I like how NOAA is a group of people that is trying to protect the ocean and the animals that live in it. They create some rules to help keep the ocean clean. They are saying that people can't throw trash or dirty water into the ocean, however there are some exceptions. For example, if people are fishing, they can throw fish parts into the ocean. If people have a special machine that cleans dirty water, they can use it to clean the water before they throw it into the ocean. People can wash their boats, however, only if the water is clean. If the water is dirty, they have to clean it on land. NOAA is making these rules to help keep the ocean clean and safe for animals.

I will be impacted because I am a California resident and the Sanctuary is in California.

I do suppose that it might make a little bit of people angry as it might take up beach space that people use on a daily basis. As well as make a lot of traffic during the construction process.

I, as a California resident, support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary.

I live in Oxnard, California and to me, the ocean has always been a big part of where I live.
Whenever I think of going to the ocean I think of my friends, it’s an easy way to hang out with my friends. The ocean has and always will be a big part of what makes California, California. I believe we should always take the opportunity to defend the ocean because we can only benefit from it.  

I want to protect the ocean not only for this generation but for the generations to come.

My name is John Perez and I support the establishment of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary so that the local ecosystem and biodiversity along California’s coast can be sheltered and preserved.

I live in Oxnard, California and to me, the ocean is very therapeutic and calming. It gives me a place to hear the sounds of nature that my ancestors before me heard too. It’s a place where I can spend time with my friends, family, and myself.
Whenever I go to the beach, it's usually with my friends. We run around the beach, enjoy snacks together, entertain the family dog, and it’s always a time I can fondly look back on.
Another time I go to the beach is on field trips with my class. I get to enjoy the warm embrace of the beach away from the environment of my school. I get to analyze, research, and interact with the local environment there like the shy crabs along the rocks or watch dolphins effortlessly swim across the ocean when I’m on a boat. 
The ocean is where a lot of my favorite foods come from too. I love foods like ceviche with shrimp, shrimp alfredo and fish with rice. In my family, it’s a tradition to eat our Mexican dishes with sea foods so the ocean is very important to me.
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, I ask that this sanctuary includes more tribes into this collaborative project. I see that tribes such as the Salinan tribes also have relation to the Channel Islands and so, I think it’d be fair to be more inclusive when in consideration of the Channel Islands protectors and inhabitants. 
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to protect and preserve California’s natural environment so that my generation and future generations can experience the beauty of California’s diversity and natural treasure.

I live in Oxnard, California and to me, the Ocean is an abundance of riches, history, and joy. Every time I go to the Ocean it's a new adventure from playing with my dogs and fishing to diving under waves with my sister. I enjoy the clean salt water and seeing the various sea creatures like sand dollars and crabs. It's a place where my dad rants and rants about the ships that come with the newest and shiniest cars and the sundial statue near the pier that honors Alaska Airlines Flight 261. 

With the designation, I wish to see the protection of Rodriguez Seamount to protect biodiversity and the support of Tribal Collaborative Management. These functions will allow many tribes to have a unified voice to do what they feel is right and protect the many animals and organisms residing in these areas such as our beloved kelp forests, southern otters, migratory whales and so much more. If the Designation gets approved then California will see a stronger tourism-based economy on the central coast and the creation of about 600 new jobs. We will also see the denial of offshore oil expansion and acoustic testing and provide funding for much-needed local marine research 

I am in favor of supporting the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary.

I am writing to express my wholehearted support for the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. As a sophomore and a passionate advocate for the environment, I believe that this sanctuary would not only benefit the Chumash people but also protect the region's important marine ecosystems and maritime heritage resources, support ocean-dependent economies, and highlight the cultural values and connections of Indigenous communities to the area.
Reasons for Support:
Preserving Indigenous Connection: The Chumash people have a strong religious and emotional connection to the ocean, and I believe that they should be supported and funded for the sanctuary to honor their heritage and traditions
Protecting Marine Life: The designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary would benefit the animals and underwater species greatly by providing them with protection against anyone and anything that may harm them
Environmental Impact: Stopping oil drilling and other harmful activities in the sanctuary would have a positive impact on the surrounding areas, including the mass population who frequent the beach, like myself, and have a love for the ocean and marine life
Fishing Opportunities: While some people may be concerned about the impact on fishing opportunities, I believe that there are alternative fishing areas where it would not be hurting the wildlife and laws can be implemented to ensure sustainable fishing practices
I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary and include measures to protect biodiversity, habitats, and the cultural values of the Chumash people. This sanctuary would be a valuable addition to the National Marine Sanctuary system, promoting collaboration, education, and community involvement in ocean management
Thank you for considering my comments in support of this important initiative. I look forward to the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary and the positive impact it will have on the environment and the community.

My name is Carla Verdin. I am a sophomore in high school and I live in Oxnard, California. 

Living near the ocean has naturally drawn me towards ocean life. Growing up I would constantly visit the beach, but not as much anymore. The beach is different, the oceans different, and life in the ocean has drastically changed. 

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. The Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary supports the well being of marine life by protecting a certain part of the ocean, creating a safer environment for all ecosystems. The Marine Sanctuary resignation would prevent wind turbines from being installed as well as offshore oil platforms. This creates a less polluted environment. This impacts me because the polluted ocean created a polluted environment too. I live here in southern California and temperatures are rising as well as sea levels, and it would be best if we prevent pollution so it doesn’t affect us or wildlife. Some oppositions come from other organizations as they think there are many organizations that are already helping with this or believe there is nothing to fix. This is a valid reasoning, as one of the questions I had was what would happen to marine life and ecology if the law is not passed? Since we don’t get total detail of what is going on in the ocean, how would people know whether to support it or not? I have now learned that the decreasing number of marine life has happened to pollution, oil, and trash that is thrown in these oceans. With this I support the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary for better oceans, ecosystems, and environments.

Sincerely, Carla

I live in Oxnard, California and to me the ocean is the guardian around my city. I’ve gone to the coast to purify my mind and separate myself from reality. The ocean has some of the best healing powers towards anyones mental health. Some of the best memories have come from being at the beach giving the ocean my eyes and attention sharing the beautiful scenery with the people I love. It would be agonizing to see such an essential part of not only my life but the thousands of people who share such a pivotal part of our city and those cities around ours. I want my ocean to prosper in health and not deteriorate, natural beauty is the best form of beauty and we need to preserve that. Not only for ourselves but for those animals who call the ocean their home and for those people who share connections with these coasts going back generations. 

I hope to see the greatest form of care towards our ocean, not just the bare minimum. I hope to see outreach towards the people and educate everyone about the importance of keeping our oceans pure and natural. I wish to never see the additions of new oil and gas development within these sanctuary boundaries. I ask for the inclusion of all tribes to be in collaborative management.

    My name is Mia, and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I live in Oxnard, California, and to me, the ocean is a place that brings my family together. My family and I enjoy spending time at the beach by eating lunch together and going into the cold and fresh seawater. The beach is one of the few locations where my family and I get to have time to enjoy each other's company. The beach is also important to me, a young teen who loves the environment of her hometown. With my support, I ask that you help improve the condition of the ocean. While the ocean is very dear to me, it’s not in the best condition right now.
     Lots of oils and harmful chemicals have been dropped into my hometown’s ocean these past few years. While I enjoy spending time at the beach, I hate the idea of swimming into oil and other nasty chemicals; it feels gross. When I heard the movement was going to prohibit harmful chemicals from being dropped into the ocean, it immediately got my attention. I want not only Oxnard’s ocean but all the oceans in the world to become healthier and cleaner. If the movement gets approved, hundreds of citizens, including myself, will be happy with this change to help better our environment.

     I'm Brisa Gonzalez, and  I do, in fact, somewhat agree with the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. The fact that I read that the Chumash lands were forcibly taken gave me the excuse to not fully support. The territory belonged to the Native Americans, according to the Lauen Sommer article ""Biden Proposes Vast New Marine Sanctuary in Partnership With California Tribe."" It was taken by force.  The land is now going to be returned. Furthermore, the Biden administration made this choice, which will result in the protection of 5,600 square miles of ocean. Why it will be returned now is my concern. Are there any benefits or drawbacks to this? 
      However, one peer, Rena Ellen Thompson, put it as letting oher adults and children have a chance to experience what she did with whales, seals, otters, etc.. and I completely agree with her.  The land will be free and returned to its natural form. The greatest course of action is to let the land be free of all the negative impacts and allow its beauty to be admired and cherished. 

Keep the lands healthy and secure, please.

Sincerely,
Brisa

I live in Oxnard, California and to me the ocean is a place I don't visit often, but when I do I always make new memories. The ocean is beautiful and mysterious. There is so much we’ve learned from it and so much to  be learned. A sanctuary will be an important part of ocean research and education for present and future generations. Over 200 ship and aircraft wrecks have been reported with at least 20 in the sanctuary area. The nationally-significant natural resources, physical features and habitats, and the cultural and historical resources within the proposed sanctuary warrant long-term protection and management to reduce threats that would negatively affect their historical, cultural, archaeological, recreational, and educational value. For example, many threatened or endangered species, such as blue whales, snowy plovers, black abalone, white sharks, and leatherback sea turtles, rely on habitats, physical features, or prey found in the proposed sanctuary rely on habitats, physical features, or prey found in the proposed sanctuary. Many known or suspected shipwrecks of historical importance have also been found in the area and the proposed sanctuary would preserve them.

My name is Abigail Tamayo and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine  Sanctuary with the initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats. This area of land is very important especially to the Chumash for cultural and spiritual reasons and I believe it should be protected.

I live in Oxnard, California and to me the ocean is a happy place, boosted by all the beach days I've had with my family over the years. When we go to the beach, we like to make sandcastles, dig holes, go boogie boarding, and play football.

The coastal waters that are being protected have important marine life and contain critical ocean ecosystems. The prohibition of oil companies and natural gas extractions on this coastal line will keep marine life healthy and thriving. Using photosynthesis, most of the oxygen and where carbon dioxide is taken is by the plants and algae in the ocean. By preserving this part of the ocean, I believe this will help slow down climate change.

One con of the sanctuary is that I’m worried how taxes will be affected due to the elimination of oil and natural gas extraction for over 7,000 miles. Gas prices have already increased a lot over the years and although it won’t affect me directly as a minor, it should be taken into account for all the middle, working class families around the country. Another con is the limited fishing areas for the west coastline. This might affect fishermen employment and increase the price of seafood in the market.

Despite these cons, I believe the pros are better. I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

I live in Oxnard, California and to me, the ocean is a big part of my life. As Oxnard is on the coast of California I like to experience the ocean whenever I can.

The ocean is important to me because I like to go out and enjoy the beach with my family and last time I went I tried skim boarding and it was super fun.
When I take trips to the beach I have so much fun with all of my family whether it's my brothers and sister or my parents, or other family. The beach is a really good time.
I support the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary because it's going to give us a much better and cleaner ocean. No dead fish in the ocean.
I think wildlife is important so I think we should clean the oceans regardless, just like a fish bowl, you should clean it if you don’t want your fish to die.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes a Ban on oil and gas, that way we can keep our oceans clean.

     I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary because it will help sea life and for the area to be protected. For example it will help the 5,600 square miles be protected so as its history it beholds of the Chumash and Salinan tribes. It will be impacted by preserving the diverse and valuable resources of the area such as kelp forest, sea otters, and migratory whales. This will be a good idea because the area has deep history which is why it shouldn’t be damaged and be protected. 

     The area has been connected to the Chumash and Salina tribes for over 100,000 years. The region also saw the first meeting between indigenous people and Europeans in the mid-1500s. This area was shaped by settlers and explorers that were Spanish, Mexican, English, Russian, and American. The events that happened were the California gold rush, ranching, military activities, oil boom, experience missions, and recent renewable energy development. The coastal waters also have precious marine life, contain critical ocean ecosystems, which are connected to the past, present, and future of the Chumash people. 

     California’s coast has been focused on the wind industry to install the states first offshore wind farms. The state has been trying to get 100% of its electricity from renewable resources by 2045. The thing is that the marine sanctuary designation would prevent the wind turbines to be installed and the same goes for the offshore oil platforms. This could have an effect on how the world is trying to grow by trying out new things, but it wouldn’t be possible because of the NOAA. The good thing is that the country’s network of 15 other marine sanctuaries are monitored for their ecological health. This means it helps spot any possible impacts and the effects of climate change. 

     In the mid-1800s the Congress rejected the treaties made with California tribes. Then tribes were able to join the sanctuary’s advisory council that provides feedback for decisions and priorities. The NOAA is working with the Chumash which means they will recognize the tribes and advise decision making as collaboratively as an Intergovernmental Policy Council. People would probably oppose this because they would need more information or just need more convincing to support the NOAA. Such as the reason for not being able to build wind turbines and offshore oil platforms.  

     In conclusion I do support the NOAA for the reason that it can help preserve the area for history of the Chumash tribe and marine life. The area can be safe and also be protected for energy development. Although wind turbines can’t be built offshore, it's better to have a different solution to it and try to save history. It will also help to create a strong foundation to have a thriving coast for generations to come in the future.

My name is Lizbeth and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the initial boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I live in Oxnard, California and the ocean/coast is a big part of my life because it holds much of our ecosystem's life. Much of the ocean's life helps our ecosystem live and continue, without it our ecosystem would fall and much life outside the ocean would be affected. Another reason why the coast is important to me is because of the city I live in, Oxnard is a seaside city, and the sea has always been a big part of my life because I’ve been able to see how the ecosystem has grown.
 
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I support the sanctuary because as I've read and analyzed, this sanctuary will have little to no impact on the economy of California, or any other impact on people's jobs or any environmental factors. My main worry was that the Sanctuary would affect our economy, and the taxes of California, and that inflation would go up again, but as stated before the Sanctuary would have little to no impact on our economy or any other factors. 

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, I ask that this sanctuary include Outreach, education, and research programs that help both Traditional ecological knowledge and access for local underserved communities. I also ask that the sanctuary include the ban on oils and gas, I ask to prohibit any new oils or gas development within the sanctuary boundaries.

My name is Sophia Espinoza and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the initial Boundary Alternative and Cavota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.
I live in California and to me,the ocean is where I enjoy being with my family and cousins and having a good time there.

I support the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary because I think it would be a nice accomplishment for the Indigenous people,because they've been wanting this for a while and I don’t think by them having their own sanctuary is a bad idea.They don’t want to cause any harm they just want to create this sanctuary because their ancestors have been maintaining this land and they want to carry on what their ancestors were trying to do.

I live in Oxnard, California and to me, the ocean is one of the most important things in the world. There’s so much we’ve learned from it, which was only 5%. There is still so much to discover, and we need to keep the most of it as we can. We could lose so many opportunities for new knowledge if we lose it.
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that the sanctuary includes:
Biggest possible boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension.
Sanctuary name: The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary.
Tribal Collaborative Management: An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management.
 Outreach & Education: Outreach, education, and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities.
Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity.
Ban Oil & Gas: A prohibition on new oil and gas development within sanctuary boundaries.

I live in Oxnard, California and to me, the ocean is a deep connection that I share with my aunt that had passed away from cancer. She had always loved seeing marine life thriving and seeing the sea birds fly over the ocean. Although she went through hard times she had always done as much as she could to help ocean life. I remember she saw a baby sea bird in the ocean almost drowning because it was covered in oil. She had taken it home to clean off the oil. My aunt had always done her best to help the ocean keep clean and be protected. I hope that the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary gets passed and helps out many animals living in the ocean. 

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes: (put what you want to see in the sanctuary) protection for ocean mammals that migrate through the coast and help if they need any. I hope the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary stops oil production companies from dumping oil into the ocean so marine animals can live a healthier life. Atlas I would like the Sanctuary to provide safety and help to create more biodiversity throughout the coast.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean's treasures.

I support the decision of the Chumash Heritage National Sanctuary and ask for this sanctuary that includes: Bank Oil & Gas.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary because I want to help this ocean be protected and safe so the communities that are related to the ocean can connect with the area and be able to experience a very beautiful and safe ocean.

Dear Paul Michel,

I, Janet Gregorio, am writing to express my support for the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. This designation would serve to protect the region's important marine ecosystems and maritime heritage resources, support ocean-dependent economies, and address issues such as climate change, offshore energy, water quality, and wildlife disturbance. 

As a resident of Oxnard, California, I believe that the ocean is a vital component of our existence and should be taken care of and revised as frequently as possible. The Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary would provide a safe and healthy ocean for my community to benefit from and connect with. 

It is crucial to protect our natural habitat in a safe enclosure since, without it, we wouldn't have the benefits that it provides us through many existing resources. The environment, climate change, offshore energy, water quality, and wildlife gradually depend on us as a community to be protected. 

I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our oceans' many features. I ask that this sanctuary include action plans that would address climate change, offshore energy, water quality, and wildlife disturbance, and be revised as frequently as possible to ensure that management is cautious about any unexpected circumstances that may arise.

My name is Giselle Morales and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats. 

I live in Oxnard, California, and I believe that this sanctuary could benefit many people. First, it would be great for the Chumash to have their culture shared with others. They have lots of fascinating traditions that they take care of. For example the text states, “Today, the Chumash people continue to honor their ancestors' traditions and connections to the sea by undertaking ocean voyages in tomol canoes and preserving their cultural heritage.” This is also good for other citizens because they can get the chance to learn about the Chumash and their culture.

I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

My name is Riley Ortega and I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary and the 7,600 square miles boundary proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

 I live in Oxnard, California and to me, the ocean is a beautiful habitat home to many organisms that should be preserved and protected.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary because I want to help protect this area of the ocean so communities that are closely related to the ocean can continue to connect with the ocean and experience a clean, safe, and healthy ocean. It is important to preserve the ocean and to make the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary because the ocean is important for current and  future generations that are closely tied to the ocean.

The estimated annual effect is less than $200 million, and the action would not adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities.The sanctuary isn't a huge effect on the economy and other factors and is worth the money being put into making it and worth the money being lost annually.


The ocean is beautiful and everyday we learn so much about it. Without this Sanctuary, I and so many people will be stripped from preserving this beautiful ocean and learning from it every day. This ocean also has cultural factors that affect people so a sanctuary should be built to preserve these cultural norms.

Many people oppose this sanctuary because they believe that it will ruin their fishing, but the fish in this sanctuary are important to the culture of the Chumash and is why a sanctuary is important. We should preserve and protect these fish because they are part of the chumash culture rather than allow people to fish them.Also, there are many other places where fishing can be successful.

In conclusion, I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

Sincerely, 
       Riley Ortega.

I am writing to express my support for the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension, covering approximately 7,600 square miles of ocean. This designation is proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats, and I believe it is a crucial step towards preserving the ocean's wonders.

As a resident of Oxnard, California, I consider the ocean to be my home. Its breeze keeps the city cool even on the hottest days, and its thriving ecosystem holds deep significance in every individual's heart. The ocean not only holds thousands of species, but the balance it creates in the world protects our ability to live as human beings.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary because I want to see the ocean's treasures protected from harm. I believe that the sanctuary's area should be safeguarded from harmful institutions such as the mass extraction of oil, fish, and other acts of exploitation with little to no regard for the environment and our future.

While I understand that some resources are necessary for society to live a comfortable and efficient life, I believe that we must prioritize the protection of our environment. Therefore, I ask for the restriction of oil and gas development within the Sanctuary's boundaries, as well as fishing and other future experimentation.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my thoughts and the implementation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I hope that we can work together to preserve the ocean and its incredible treasures for current and future generations to enjoy and thrive in.

My name is Jordan Lazcano and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of the Ocean proposed to protect the biodiversity and habitats. 

I live in Oxnard California and to me the ocean is a place of comfort and peace.

When my family and I go to the beach the last thing we want to be greeted with is large landfills and stained water. It is not fair to the ocean life and people who resonate deeply with the ocean. There is a much more spiritual bond between the ocean and  people like the Chumash who’s once clear ocean blue waves were turned into clouds of oil and darkness. My family and I love watching the sunset and the elegant fish that swim by, but I fear that this will not be possible in the years to come. The ocean is a place of comfort to not only us, but also the marine life that is affected by every single incident that happens with boats. The sanctuary will help solve these issues by the NOAA prohibiting harmful materials on grounded or deserted vessels. This will keep boats that sink, run aground, or discharge chemicals into the ocean from releasing anything that may harm the sanctuary or marine life. 

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary bans the use of oil and gas to prevent any pollution that could be let into the ocean. According to statista.com, In 2022 700 metric tons of oil were let into the ocean killing marine life. People that do not support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary fear that fishing will not be allowed. I respect the fear of losing something you enjoy, but there will be nothing to fish in the ocean if we allow incidents to recur and the abuse the ocean endures to continue. With the installment of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary dozens of species of fish will be protected and the Chumash will have a piece of their home back that they once lost.

I support the designation of the Chumash National Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

Also, the marine environment of the proposed sanctuary has provided and continues to provide a special sense of place to its changing coastal communities and visitors because of its aesthetic, and biological resources. To add on, it would affect me personally because I love the ocean. Even though when I was younger I was to scared to even go near the water I am know able to just stand in it , I love going to just watch the sunset and collect sea glass and it has been a big part of my life recently because I have been able to go and it brings me a lot of peace and i'm able to relax and forget about everything and I would prefer to just leave it the way it is.

I live in Oxnard California and to me the ocean is a place of comfort and relaxation of mind.

When I go to the beach with my family and try to have a good time together, the last thing I want to see is large landfills and oil all over. It’s not okay for ocean life and those who love the beach to be having to deal with this problem.

The Central Coast Friends Meeting (Quakers) offers this statement of support for the proposed Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary.  Our principles of harmony with nature and of right relationships with Creation bring us to make this statement.

We support the establishment of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary using the largest possible contiguous sanctuary boundaries, as shown in the Initial Boundary Alternative combined with the Gaviota Coast Extension (Sub-Alternative 5b), because it would provide the most protection.   Our beloved coastal and offshore waters in San Luis Obispo County would be subjected to drilling, dumping, and desecration of sacred sites in alternative boundaries 2, 3, and 4 proposed by NOAA. We request that any cables laid in sanctuary waters have permits from the Office of National Marine Sanctuaries.

Migrating marine animals need safe passage through our waters.  Lisamu, which we call Morro Rock, needs protection so that never again will we take rocks from this sacred site. Our indigenous neighbors have wisdom to share based on 10,000 years of living in harmony with the land and waters. We support strong collaboration among local agencies and tribes in regulating and managing the sanctuary to include all interested local tribes.

The proposed boundaries do not protect the Morro Bay estuary, a critical ecosystem home to dozens of endangered species[1].

The estuary has seen conservation efforts from local, state and federal programs including the NEP[2], however these efforts are focused on preserving the watershed. The magic of an estuary is the mixture of water and sediments coming from both inland and the ocean, and it is critical to protect the coastline outside the estuary to preserve this habitat. It has been shown that offshore industrial uses often have negative impacts on nearby estuaries [3][4], including NOAA's own research [5].

I fully support extending the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to the border of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary.

My name is Stephanie Allen and I am a full-time resident of a beach town impacted by this decision on the Central Coast of California. I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

As mentioned above, I live in this specific beach town on in California and for one reason and one reason only - the opportunity it gave me to live in proximity to this amazing stretch of the Pacific Ocean along the Central Coast. I am a surfer, boogie boarder, beach walker, nature appreciator and observer.

I have been a homeowner in this area, one block from the beach since 2009.  This beach and ocean have saved my life -- while grieving the sudden and tragic deaths of beloveds, it gave me hope for the future during the pandemic lockdown and the protests of the summer of 2020 and even now while war is raging in Ukraine and Israel and Gaza.  When at the beach - watching surfers and dogs play, seeing families out in the waves or exploring the tide pools, feeling the serenity from the fisherpeople as they cast their rods I find glimmers of possibility for humanity.  I am awed by the migrations of birds and bait balls, the breaching whales and dolphin, the changeability and power of the wind, the glory of the sunsets, the ever presence and ever changing ocean; wave quality, color, texture, power and grace.  And - make no mistake - I am reminded of the harsh realities of the world - often - as I come upon dead birds, seals, sea otters and more, the bones of a whale or a cormorant.

It is imperative for us to protect and honor this stretch of ocean so we can all continue to connect with, find grace in and benefit from a clean, safe, and healthy ocean.

The ocean is beautiful and mysterious and it provides infinite opportunities from which we can learn and connect peacefully.  

I fully, and wholehearted support this Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary - in the full designation as proposed by the Northern Chumash Tribal Council.  Think to the future generations.  Consider history and how many short termed decisions have put us at risk.  Let's not make those same mistakes.

The Sanctuary must include:
1) Biggest Possible Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension
2) Tribal Collaborative Management: An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management.
3) Outreach & Education: Outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities
4) Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity
5) A Ban on Oil & Gas: A prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries

To reiterate in the strongest possible terms: I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

Respectfully,
Stephanie Allen

Thank you for the opportunity to support the INITIAL Boundary Alternative for the proposed Chumash Heritage NMS.

As a former employee of NOAA's Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary, now retired but continuing my involvement in marine conservation activities, I am familiar with many aspects of sanctuary management and policy, and therefore support only the INITIAL alternative originally published in the Federal Register that will create an uninterrupted corridor of legal protections for significant natural and cultural resources. No non-contiguous option is acceptable. 

These waters support a host of protected and endangered species and critical habitats for them, in one of the most significant upwelling regions on the planet. This alone merits the utmost effort to maintain, conserve and restore its biological resources and habitats. Its proximity to offshore oil development already compromise the health of these waters, and this must prompt an extra layer of protection for the proposed marine protected area. 

The INITIAL alternative ensures that offshore industrial development is subject to the same regulatory protections for habitat integrity and wildlife that apply to other national marine sanctuaries, and to other areas of this proposed sanctuary. While I support development of green energy alternatives, including potential offshore industrial installations for wind and wave energy if done responsibly, the most rigorous scrutiny is needed before issuance of permits or authorizations to ensure it is carried out with minimal environmental impact and impacts to fisheries. I'm a realist and know that trade-offs are a necessary evil. I further appreciate that NOAA is under the US Department of Commerce, and not the Interior. However, I believe that commerce and conservation are not incompatible. The inclusion of the Morro Bay and other areas missing from the agency-preferred option will provide a stronger framework for enforcing environmental protections as development proposals are initiated. The energy industry's track record - whether for carbon based fuels or otherwise - does not merit  special exemptions; indeed, it warrants extra caution. In our haste to meet state and federal goals, ref: the 30/30 objectives, we should not waive our obligation to minimize impacts in achieving those goals.

Please confirm the INITIAL Boundary Alternative for the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Mary Jane Schramm",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

Dear Paul Michel,
My name is German Lopez and i support the idea that is soon to become true of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. It has gotten a immense grasp of my attention to see that this project will not only benefit marine life but the environment from climate change and for possible dangers, And i wish for you to keep thriving with the idea and make it true one day.
I live in the City of oxnard and seeing that the ocean is going to be hugely benefited from the soon to come project, I am quite happy and thankful to see the amazing change.
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary.

I support it because The Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary would protect 5,600 square miles of ocean off the central California coast, an area known for its kelp forests, sea otters and migratory whales. 
Executive Order 12898 is a directive that requires Federal agencies to identify and address the disproportionately high and adverse effects of their actions on human health and the environment of minority or low-income populations. The goal of this order is to achieve environmental protection for all communities, including those that are often overlooked or underserved. The designation of national marine sanctuaries by NOAA helps to ensure the enhancement of environmental quality for all populations in the United States. The proposed sanctuary designation would not result in disproportionate negative impacts on any minority or low-income population. In fact, many of the potential impacts from designating the proposed sanctuary would result in long-term or permanent beneficial impacts by protecting sanctuary resources, which may have a positive impact on communities by providing employment and educational opportunities, and potentially result in improved ecosystem services. The Executive Order 12898 is an important tool for promoting environmental justice and ensuring that all communities have access to clean and healthy environments. It is important for Federal agencies to consider the potential impacts of their actions on minority and low-income populations and take steps to address any adverse effects.
NOAA is proposing to designate a national marine sanctuary off the coast of central California. The proposed sanctuary would include the coastline of central California from Hazard Canyon Reef at the north end of Montaña de Oro State Park, south along the San Luis Obispo County coast and a portion of Santa Barbara County to approximately two miles south of Dos Pueblos Creek near the township of Naples along the Gaviota Coast. The sanctuary's proposed boundaries also include the offshore marine waters from the western end of Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary (CINMS), northwards to within approximately 2.5 miles of the southern end of Morro Bay Wind Energy Area (WEA), and then east and southeast to the point of origin at Hazard Canyon Reef. The proposed sanctuary would cover roughly 134 miles of the mainland coast (163 miles if including the shoreline of offshore rocks and islands) and out to approximately 66 miles (50 nautical miles) from shore. The area includes numerous offshore features, such as the Santa Lucia Bank, portions of its escarpment, Rodriguez Seamount, Arguello Canyon, and other offshore features and resources. Coastal watersheds drain into this area via multiple outlets, including the Santa Maria and Santa Ynez river mouths and several other coastal streams and rivers. The area is known for its high biological productivity, which supports dense aggregations of marine life. The proposed sanctuary would balance protection with recreational use and would help conserve and manage coastal resources to protect them from potential threats.
It would help impact all people especially due to it being able to spot possible signs of effects and climate change.
The reason i do support the work and project going into this idea is due to it having a positive impact towards marine life and the plants but not only that but the positive impact that is going to bring towards climate change and possible detectable effects.

My name is Isabella Martinez and I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I live in Oxnard, California, and to me, the ocean is beautiful. If we’re able to support this sanctuary we’d be able to hold the natural beauty it gives. This could also be the start of keeping our oceans safe, and clean and not harming wildlife. It could protect the future generations of learning so we can continue to pass on what we’ve learned from it. I really hope that by supporting this sanctuary it could help make a difference in ocean life.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary be able to include an equitable approach to include all tribes in collaborative management. I like to see the tribes be represented there as it is on Chumash land. I would also like to see the sanctuary bring a nice, friendly, and clean space that is safe for animals that live there. I would also like for our animals out there to benefit from this by having a clean ocean and get protected and not being harmed.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow for current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

Sincerely,

I support the Chumash marine sanctuary designation. I am a lifelong waterman and have surfed and swam in these waters responsibly since I was a child, and my children now do as well. I am a passionate environmentalist. I am a big wave surfer and much of my use of this area, now occurs when some of the largest waves of winter occur in our region.  Many of you may not know that the area covered under the proposed marine sanctuary  includes numerous surf spots with waves similar in size and ferocity to the famous Mavericks in half moon bay. These areas are exceptionally dangerous, with waves from 20-50 foot throughout most winters. Many of these waves are very far from shore and are often exceptionally difficult to access from shore. Many of them can only be accessed via PWC. There is a small number of big wave surfers who use this region for both paddle and tow in surfing in these types of conditions. Personal Watercraft are an absolutely integral portion of maintaining our safety in these situations and are used to rescue surfers after a fall, or to quickly get out of harms way. In the event of an emergency such as a shark attack, a drowning, or any other injury, PWC operators in conjunction with the other surfers in the water,  function as the first line of defense in providing advanced lifesaving care. We are trained to self rescue and we have first aid kits, tourniquets, and often defibrillator devices onboard our PWC’s. Many of us are trained in CPR and first aid. I am a private citizen, however I have trained with the half moon bay harbor patrol, the US coastguard, Cal Fire, and many other agencies in regards to PWC operation for Ocean Safety. Most other PWC assisted surfers have similar training.  All the Surfers I know are responsible environmentalists. We are cognizant of wildlife and marine mammals during these activities and give them a wide berth if ever encountered. We are far more agile than a boat and can turn on a dime. Strikes on wildlife by PWC operators like this are non existent.   

Surfers have died surfing big waves in Central California, when PWC’s are not able to be a part of the safety plan. At the end of the day we all want to come home safely to our families and having unfettered access to utilize PWC’s for safety makes the overall process much safer for us. While I understand there is currently no ban on PWC operation within the draft regulations, if the sanctuary were to follow in the footsteps of either the Channel Islands or Monterey marine National sanctuaries management plans, PWC use would be banned. While I understand they are not being banned now, the language in the action plan is concerning n (see draft management plan, Wildlife Disturbance Action Plan, Activity WD-1.2). I implore you to realize that it is a small number of conscious environmentally minded waterman who are actually utilizing these areas with these machines, and very often it truly is a matter of life and death to have one of these machines in an emergency. A second but no less important point is that regarding the Gaviota coastline extension as currently proposed, PWC’s offer one of the only ways to access this entire stretch of coastline, as all land access is currently prohibited due to the Hollister and Bixby ranch private regions. Please do not change this. The photo I have attached is of a location in the proposed sanctuary with these types of PWC assisted surfing activities. Thank you.

I live in Oxnard California and to me, the ocean is a place that I will like to protect for many many years to come. It would bring benefits to the environment if we do keep it protected.

I am writing in support of the proposed Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. This sanctuary would protect a rich and diverse marine ecosystem, including endangered species and important migration corridors, as well as culturally significant sites for the Chumash and other indigenous people.

**Rich biodiversity**

The proposed santuary encompasses a wide range of marine habitats, including kelp forests, rocky reefs, sandy beaches, and deep-sea canyons. These habitats support a diverse array of marine life, including fish, invertebrates, seabirds, and marine mammals. The sanctuary would protect important nursery and feeding grounds for many commercially and recreationally important species, such as salmon, tuna, and whales. Citizens of all ages recognize and value this proposed sanctuary and it is largely celebrated, explored by involved organizations, student groups, advocacy groups and local docents. 

**Indigenous historical legacy and input in management**

The Chumash people have inhabited the Central California coast for over 10,000 years. They have a deep understanding of the marine environment and its resources. The proposed sanctuary would be co-managed by the Chumash people (or a coalition of indigenous tribal representatives) and NOAA, ensuring that their traditional knowledge and values are incorporated into management decisions. The Marine Sanctuary designation is vital at this time to ensure that harmful and irreversable development would be mitigated including energy technologies such as oil and gas tec and the burgeoning space exploration managed through Vandenberg Air Force Base and Space Force.

**Influence and decision-making of local stewardship and environmental organizations**

Local stewardship and environmental organizations have played a key role in advocating for the Chumash Heritage Marine Sanctuary. These organizations have provided valuable input into the sanctuary designation process and will continue to be involved in its management. Their engagement will help to ensure that the sanctuary is managed in a way that protects its natural and cultural resources for future generations. I was a young child as my Mother, an Anthropologist specializing in Chumash Heritage pointed out the importance of the cultuaral and environmental legacy. And 50 years later, the importance of this stewardship is more important than ever.  

**Precious habitats including endangered species and migration corridors for birds and marine animals**

As a local naturalist and volunteer of several organization and Google Guide, I chronicle the and write on the rich habitat. The proposed Sanctuary is home to a number of endangered species, including the blue whale, humpback whale, and southern sea otter. It is also an important migration corridor for many birds and marine mammals. The sanctuary would provide these species with protected habitat and help to ensure their long-term survival. Meanwhile, threats including poaching, aggressive treatment against otters and unchecked kelp harvesting needs enforcement and protection. 

**Geological position and seismic activity**

The proposed CHNMS is located in a geologically active region. This means that there is a risk of earthquakes, tsunamis, and other natural disasters. Offshore oil and gas development in this region would pose a significant risk to marine life and coastal communities. The CHNMS would prohibit offshore oil and gas development, helping to protect the marine environment and coastal communities from these risks.

**Exemptions to sanctuary boundaries**

I urge NOAA to minimize exemptions to the sanctuary boundaries. Exemptions would increase the risk of damage to the marine environment from activities such as offshore oil and gas development, seabed mining, and dumping. It is important to protect the entire marine ecosystem within the sanctuary boundaries, including its important habitats and endangered species.

**Scientific collaborative research**

I encourage NOAA to continue to support scientific collaborative research with local credible universities. This research will help us to better understand the marine environment and its resources. It will also help us to develop effective management strategies for the sanctuary.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I urge you to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary.

Sincerely,
[Mary Uebersax]

In addition to the points above, I would like to add that the CHNMS would also provide a number of economic benefits to the Central Coast region. The sanctuary would attract tourists, recreational anglers, and other visitors to the region, supporting local businesses and jobs. The sanctuary would also help to protect the marine resources that are essential to the region's fishing and tourism industries.

The CHNMS is a win-win for the environment, the economy, and the Chumash people. I urge NOAA to designate the sanctuary as soon as possible.",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/NOAA-NOS-2021-0080-2985/attachment_10.jpg,https://downloads.regulations.gov/NOAA-NOS-2021-0080-2985/attachment_9.jpg,https://downloads.regulations.gov/NOAA-NOS-2021-0080-2985/attachment_8.jpg,https://downloads.regulations.gov/NOAA-NOS-2021-0080-2985/attachment_7.jpg,https://downloads.regulations.gov/NOAA-NOS-2021-0080-2985/attachment_6.jpg,https://downloads.regulations.gov/NOAA-NOS-2021-0080-2985/attachment_2.jpg,https://downloads.regulations.gov/NOAA-NOS-2021-0080-2985/attachment_5.jpg,https://downloads.regulations.gov/NOAA-NOS-2021-0080-2985/attachment_3.jpg,https://downloads.regulations.gov/NOAA-NOS-2021-0080-2985/attachment_1.jpg,https://downloads.regulations.gov/NOAA-NOS-2021-0080-2985/attachment_4.jpg","pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

I write to express my strong support for the prompt designation of the proposed Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary off the central Californis coast.
I'm a longtime California resident, and longtime advocate for environmental protection, especially concerned now with the biodiversity crisis that is worldwide, and that is being addressed, in part, by California's new law making th ""30 by 30"" initiative truly law in our state.  I work with several environmental organizations, including Sierra CLub, Great Old Broads for Wilderness, and California Native Plant Society 
I urge the designation WITH the Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension. This broad inclusive boundary is vital: Including the waters offshore Point Buchon, Morro Bay, Cayucos, and Cambria will close the California Central Coast’s biodiversity protection gap between Monterey Bay and Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuaries. This will protect the only eelgrass bed in a 300-mile stretch of coast; many historic Chumash sites, including Lisamu’ (Morro Rock); numerous protected marine mammals and shorebirds; the highest population of Southern Sea otters on the California coast; several State Marine Conservation Areas; and the kelp forests and rocky intertidal habitat. The protection of Rodriguez Seamount should be included.
I also support using the name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary.
I urge continuing Tribal Collaborative Management--this sanctuary is proposed first of all by tribes and they deserve a strong leadership voice in ongoing management.An inclusive approach to all Tribes in Collaborative Management & a NOAA Tribal Liaison.
While I emphatically support further focus on and use of offshore wind resources, the potential for harm to ocean life requires thoughtful planning of Offshore Wind farms to protect ocean life. Careful sitting is imperative.
Designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, spanning over 7,500 square miles of ocean and 156 miles of coastline, in addition to biodiversity protection, will also benefit local communities and the economy. 
The Draft Environmental Impact Statement acknowledges that all other alternatives than the Initial Alternative --all with reduced boundaries would reduce the significant beneficial effects on biological resources provided by the Initial Boundary Alternative. All other alternatives would increase the vulnerability of those resources to adverse impacts that the Initial Boundary Alternative would prohibit or mitigate. The Initial Boundary Alternative is expected to result in long-term beneficial impacts on local residents (including low-income and minority populations), as well as on the health and well-being of children.

I look forward eagerly to this new designation. Our oceans are the least publicized and most endangered ecosystems on earth. YOUr help can now work toward improving this global situation.
Thank you for considering these comments.

I am writing in support of the proposed Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. It’s important to establish the Marine Sanctuary, it’s an important area for the Chumash people due to cultural significance, and also this area is ecologically significant.
The Chumash and other indigenous tribes have been in this area for thousands of years. They have knowledge of the area and also it’s culturally important to them due to them being connected to the ocean. They have lived off the resources the ocean provides.  With the government and indigenous people working together they’d be able to ensure a sustainable future for California's ocean.
Ecologically this area is high in biodiversity and a highly productive marine ecosystem. This area is made up of kelp forests, sandy beaches, rocky shorelines, shallow and deep reefs, and wetlands. These areas provide a important habitat to many sea birds, marine mammals, invertebrates, and fishes. This area also serves as a gathering point for whales and dolphins to feed.
There are also three major upwelling occur in this area, they bring nutrient rich water to the surface which feeds marine life and they also enhance the ecosystems of the two adjacent sanctuaries. If this is disturbed there would be a disruption in the ecosystem. 
Also while I do support wind power, we should not build a wind farm where whales and many other marine animals live. They habitat are likely to be disturbed with the building of these wind farms. Also the whales travel pattern is likely to be affected by these wind farms. The better alternative is to build these wind farms on land and not in the sanctuary area since it would not affect the habitats of marine organisms and travel patterns of whales.

I am writing today in support of the Chumash Heritage Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and the Gaviota Coast Extension to cover 7,600 square miles of ocean biodiversity.

I was born and raised along the California coast.  I currently live on the California coast north of the proposed Chumash Heritage Marine Sanctuary, but I still feel that the designation is very important for all people in California and in our country.  As an environmental attorney, I understand the need to proactively work to keep resources protected, rather than try to address pollution, species or other issues in a piecemeal approach.  By designating this Sanctuary, and working in tandem with the Chumash tribe, the traditional ecological knowledge that has been used by the tribe to manage and care for the environment for thousands of years will be given a necessary and essential role in resource management. 

I urge NOAA to adopt the sanctuary with the following elements.

I support the Chumash Marine Sanctuary, specifically the largest possible designation of the Initial Boundary Alternative with the Gaviota Coast Extension.

I support the name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”.

I support an equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management.

I support outreach and education to highlight Traditional Ecological Knowledge and to grant access to local underserved communities.

I support the protection of the Rodriguez Seamount.

The new Marine Sanctuary must prohibit the development of new oil and gas projects within the sanctuary boundaries.


The Chumash tribe has been living near and managing these resources for thousands of years.  When the Portola Expedition traveled through the area in 1769, they encountered numerous villages with a settled culture that utilized the marine resources providing the Spaniards with fresh and dried fish (among many other food sources.) See, The Discovery of San Francisco Bay: The Portola Expedition, The Diary of Miguel Costanso, Ed. By Peter Browning. The Chumash tribe has maintained a tribal identity and their traditional knowledge in the face of waves of attempted destruction beginning with the Spanish priests and military at the Missions and followed by the State of California’s aggressive attacks on the California native populations, and federal policies through the years. This sanctuary designation as a Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary will be a positive step to help counter some of this destructive history. It will be an opportunity for the Chumash tribe to continue to exercise their traditional knowledge and for other people to learn about their long history with the ocean in this area. We can all benefit from their knowledge and respect for the ocean environment. In Voices in the Ocean, Susan Casey summarizes the relationship between the Chumash and the ocean, drawing from her conversation with a Chumash activist regarding their creation story, and the relationship to dolphins and the whole area of the ocean.  This connection between resource management and spirituality is a necessary one for us to learn.  It is time to recognize that the California Native tribes who were here for thousands of years before this area was the State of California or the United States are still here and have a tremendous amount to teach all of us about the ocean and our connection to it. 

Please designate the Chumash Heritage Marine Sanctuary with the largest possible are of the Initial Boundary Alternative and the Gaviota Coast Extension.  

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

My name is Jennifer Pick and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I live in Columbus Ohio and to me, the ocean is not only a place of beauty and respite for those who can visit it, but the source of so much life, not just the fish and corals in the seas but the water that comes to us via the local cycles, where the run off from forests nourishes the underwater life and the water evaporates to provide the rain that nourishes us all on land.  It is also the home of so many sentient species whose existence brings us joy.  I will never forget sailing off the coast of Australia and being accompanied by dolphins swimming by the prow of the boat.  We have greedily emptied the oceans for profit and left many larger fish starving, think of the plight of the Orca's on the west coast.  However, there is hope.  Numerous examples exist of the way nature can rebound when protected from the ravages of overfishing and other insults such as trawl fishing. The Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary in the Gulf of Maine is a great example.  As we head into the fiery future of climate change, it is important to take every step we can to protect what we can, while we can.  If you are not aware of the global 30 by 30 project, it hopes to protect 30% of both land and water for its biodiversity as a way to stave off the growing extinction crisis.  This has been endorsed by President Biden, 100 nations and many conservation groups.  It was also endorsed by the COP15 meeting of the Convention on Biological Diversity.  The proposed sanctuary would be a wonderful contribution to this effort, provided that it imposes strict limits on or excludes completely commercial fishing.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes:

Biggest Possible Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension
Sanctuary Name: The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”
Tribal Collaborative Management: An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management.
Outreach & Education: Outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities
Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity
Ban Oil & Gas: A prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

I live in Richmond, California and went to school at Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo where I earned my degree in Landscape Architecture.  To me, the ocean is part of our cultural heritage and protecting it is an honor the Chumash should receive.

At Cal Poly I competed in the Solar Decathlon with a team of architecture students to design sustainable a home for Reggie, a member of the Chumash tribe in Santa Ynez, California. He had a vision of his whole community modernizing their homes to be sustainable to ease the burden on the earth.  He was serious about his commitment a sustainable future for the next generations and fighting climate change.

I know he would want this wind farm. But it's also important that the future of the coast at Morro Bay be in their hands.  We've had a chance to shape it already- adding a sand bar and power plant.  It's time to give others the opportunity to shape the outcome.  People who are serious about protecting the earth and have everything to lose because this is part of their community.

My name is Veronika Krahe and I am writing to provide clear support for the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I am a civil water resources engineer in San Francisco, CA and studied in San Luis Obispo. The coastline at Morro is critical to the well being of the native and non-native populations. I understand the competition for protection between biodiversity and resilient, renewable energy sources - but I believe that it is critical to listen to the indigenous voices calling for heritage protections. The Wind Farm needs to be considered in areas that are not held as sacred by those who have been perpetually displaced.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary envelops the largest possible boundary as shown intThe Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension. It is ciritial the tribe is incorporated sustainably in the establishment and long term management of the sanctuary. Tribal Collaborative Management will ensure an equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management. Finally, I support a ban on oil & Gas to prohibit new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries.

Dear Paul Michel,

My name is Sonia North, and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I live in Santa Cru, CA, and to me, the ocean is a part of my daily existence. I have spent countless hours walking our beautiful coastline, sharing days at the beach with my children while also teaching them about our beloved oceans and conservation, watching my husband surf for hours on end, participated in many beach cleanup, and enjoyed countless sunsets. All of this time spent near the coast keeps me in rhythm with myself and the natural world, while also allowing me to find a balance between work life and other stresses that come from living in our modern world. When I find myself near the coast, I feel a peace wash over me and begin to breathe in a natural rhythm. 

I feel it extremely essential  to protect this stretch of ocean, so my community of ocean lovers can continue to connect with and benefit from a clean, safe, and healthy ocean.  A sanctuary will also be able to provide an important part of ocean research and education for present and future generations. It is past the time where we should be concerned and now must turn into action to protect what little bits of the earth we still have available to protect!

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes: 
Biggest Possible Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension, Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity, 
Tribal Collaborative Management: An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management, and most importantly to me,
Ban Oil & Gas: A prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries! 

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

My name is Layla Olivero, and I am a high school student currently attending Pacifica High School (in Oxnard). I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary.

I live in Oxnard, California and to me, the ocean is a place of significance. The memories alone I have of being by the water are close to my heart. Growing up in a city that’s significantly close to the water, it has always been a part of my life. Birthdays, weddings, field trips, etc, are all celebrated and take place on the coast and beaches. The ocean is deeply important to myself and my community. We all depend on the ocean for recreational purposes, our mental and spiritual well-being, and our community connections and health. I support protecting this stretch of the ocean so that my community can continue to connect with it and benefit from it under safe, clean, and healthy circumstances. A sanctuary that is a part of the ocean will help us not only bring to light the protectors of these waters, but also help educate our community on the significance of the waters. As well, a sanctuary can also be an aspect of research and education used for present and future generations. 

Since I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, there are some causes I strongly support and wish to be included within the building of this sanctuary. The ban on oil and gas idea: a prohibition on new oil and gas development within the sanctuary boundaries. I support this ban idea specifically because of how badly our planet alone has been affected by the oil and gas industry, and if one area can maybe change the way oil and gas is affecting them, then maybe the rest of the planet will follow. 

In conclusion, I do support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. Based on my reasoning, I hope you agree with my statement.  I do urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow present and future generations to protect, enjoy, and benefit from our ocean’s many beautiful treasures. 

Sincerely, 
Layla Olivero <3

It is all of our responsibilities to do everything we can to advocate for our natural resources, which include the ocean and all of the biodiversity remaining there. I strongly support the designation of the proposed Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I advocate for the full original boundaries of the proposed sanctuary with the Gaviota coast extension. I advocate for a name that is inclusive of all the indigenous people of the sanctuary area. Current alck of consensus should not be used as a justification to eliminate any regions from the sanctuary boundaries. Collaborative management should include all of the tribal groups that are indigenous to the area of the proposed sanctuary. No tribe can make a decision for other tribes. Each tribe speaks for itself. The diverse Chumash and Salinan tribes, regardless of federal recognition status, need to be on equal footing with regards to input and management decisions. 
I support well regulated greed energy alternatives within the boundaries of teh sanctuary that do not come at the cost of long term ocean protections. The proposed wind farm is not an appropriate justification for excluding the Morro Bay area from the sanctuary boundaries. An acceptable wind farm should be able to meet the regulatory requirements of the sanctuary. Excluding the Morro Bay area from the sanctuary leaves that sacred and ecologically essential area vulnerable, not only to the wind farm, but other industrial purposes such as sea floor mining, oil drilling, and increased ship traffic. 
Please protect these natural resources and ancestral waters.

    My name is Brennan Tagudar and I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. As a Californian, I want to support anything that protects our environment for future generations, so some information I would need to know to make my decision is how and if this sanctuary helps with the environment for ocean life. 

The seabed is an important habitat in the ecosystem of the proposed sanctuary, and NOAA wants to prevent activities that would harm the habitat and species on or near the seafloor. Therefore, NOAA proposes to prohibit activities that would drill into, dredge, or otherwise alter or disturb the submerged lands of the sanctuary. This prohibition would include constructing, placing, or abandoning any structure, material, or other matter on the submerged lands. However, there are some exceptions to this prohibition, such as disturbance during the conduct of lawful fishing activities, kelp harvesting, or anchoring a vessel. NOAA also proposes to except from this prohibition the installation of an aid to navigation, as well as the repair, replacement, or other maintenance on existing structures, specifically docks, piers, breakwaters, or jetties. Additionally, maintenance dredging of the entrance channels for Port San Luis in existence at the time the sanctuary is designated is also exempted. Vandenberg Space Force Base periodically conducts dredging near its coastal loading dock, with onshore disposal of the sand, but that dredging disturbance would be exempted with the general exemption for existing Department of Defense activities. NOAA has also proposed an exception to allow for drilling, maintaining, and abandoning wells incidental and necessary to normal oil and gas production activities within or into existing reservoirs in production at the time of sanctuary designation from Platforms Irene or Heritage.

The sanctuary contains significant natural resources, physical features, habitats, and cultural and historical resources that need long-term protection and management to reduce threats that would adversely affect their historical, cultural, archaeological, recreational, and educational value. These natural resources can benefit me and others. The area is home to many threatened or endangered species, such as blue whales, snowy plovers, black abalone, white sharks, and leatherback sea turtles, that rely on habitats, physical features, or prey found in the proposed sanctuary and with a balanced ecosystem in the ocean, that benefits scientists and us people.

The Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary has faced opposition from some individuals who are concerned about the impact of wind turbines, future renewable energy, and the regulation of introducing and releasing species into the sanctuary. However, it is important to consider the benefits of the sanctuary, which include protecting an internationally significant ecological transition zone that is home to a wide variety of wildlife, including many at-risk species, such as snowy plovers.  Additionally, the sanctuary would connect two existing sanctuaries, forming a network where ocean wildlife can roam, and would protect an offshore area along 140 miles of California coastline, which is a diverse hotspot with a range of habitat types from coastal estuaries to deep sea canyons, and migratory paths frequented by marine mammals such as dolphins and whales 

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I support anything that protects our environment for future generations and for them to protect, benefit, and enjoy the ocean.

Sincerely,

While the essay is rather long, I would like to submit it as a further explanation of the issue of the alternative boundaries proposed by the NOAA. I hope that the NOAA is able to take into consideration other perspectives and critically reconsider the cultural and larger-scale impacts of leaving the Morro Bay wind energy corridor open for development. I think that this project is more than just an environmental project but an important cultural project that, if succeeds, reestablishes indigenous agency and self-determination.

Planned wind projects off the New England coast threaten to harm the region’s dwindling population of endangered right whales, according to a US government marine scientist.

The warning from a top National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration official, obtained by Bloomberg under a Freedom of Information Act request, underscores the potential legal and environmental perils of offshore wind development along the coast. President Joe Biden has a goal of deploying 30 gigawatts of offshore wind within the decade. his strong correlation is strong evidence of causation, especially since no other possible cause has appeared.

To begin with, offshore lease sales really geared up 2015-16, with nine big sales off New Jersey, New York, Delaware and Massachusetts. These sales must have generated a lot of activity, likely including potentially damaging sonar.

In fact 2016 also saw the beginning of what are called geotechnical and site characterization surveys. These surveys are actually licensed by NOAA Fisheries, under what are called Incidental Harassment Authorizations or IHA’s.

There is some seriously misleading jargon here. IHA’s are incidental to some other activity, in this case offshore wind development. They are not incidental to the whales. In fact the term “harassment” specifically includes injuring the whales. That is called “level A harassment”.

To date NOAA has issued an astounding 46 one-year IHA’s for offshore wind sites. Site characterization typically includes the protracted use of what I call “machine gun sonar”. This shipboard device emits an incredibly loud noise several times a second, often for hours at a time, as the ship slowly maps the sea floor.

Mapping often takes many days to complete. A blaster can log hundreds of miles surveying a 10-by-10 mile site. Each IHA is typically for an entire year.There are lots of ways this sonar blasting might cause whales to die. Simply fleeing the incredible noise could cause ship strikes or fish gear entanglements, the two leading causes of whale deaths. Of the whales could be deafened, increasing their chances of being struck by a ship later on. Direct bleeding injury, like getting their ears damaged, is another known risk, possibly leading to death from infection. So there can be a big time difference between blasting and death.

Note also that these deaths need not be in the immediate vicinity of the sonar blasting, so spatial correlation is unlikely. Humpbacks in particular are prodigious travelers. One group was tracked traveling 3,000 miles in just 28 days, over 100 miles a day on average. Another group routinely migrates 5,000 miles. Both are winter-summer migrations which can happen twice a year.

Thus a sonar blasting, site characterization in one place could easily lead to multiple whale deaths hundreds of miles away. If one of these blasters suddenly goes off near a group of whales they might go off in different directions, then slowly die.

The point is that the huge 2016 jump in annual humpback mortality coincides with the huge jump in NOAA Incidental Harassment Authorizations. It is that simple and surely NOAA Fisheries knows this.Nor is this just about humpbacks. Some of the dead whales off New Jersey are endangered sperm whales. And of course there are the severely endangered North Atlantic Right Whales, on the verge of extinction.

Even worse, the IHA’s are about to make a much bigger jump. There are eleven pending IHA applications and eight of these are for actually constructing 8 different monster wind “farms”.

Driving the hundreds of enormous monopiles that hold up the turbine towers and blades will be far louder than the sonic blasters approved to date, especially with eight sites going at once. These construction sites range from Virginia to Massachusetts, with a concentration off New Jersey and New York.

This animation is embarrassing and pathetic. It is not supported by evidence of whale movement which include flips and flipper movements getting caught in cable: https://www.boem.gov/about-boem/humpback-whales-and-floating-offshore-wind-farms ",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

       My name is Andres Diaz and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats. As a Californian I would love to support anything that would help and protect our environment and would like to understand if future generations will be affected by being unable to expand.
        Executive Order 12898 is a law that requires federal agencies to identify and address any negative effects their actions may have on the environment and human health of minority or low-income populations. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) designates national marine sanctuaries to improve environmental quality for all populations in the United States. The proposed sanctuary designation would not have a negative impact on any minority or low-income population. In fact, it could have long-term or permanent beneficial impacts by protecting sanctuary resources, which may provide employment and educational opportunities and improve ecosystem services. This means that the proposed sanctuary designation would not harm any minority or low-income populations and could actually benefit them in the long run.
          The Sanctuary will protect our animals and natural habitats but they will be scared from having any buildings or expansions to the area and will affect us as in our oils and turbines built for renewable energy. As well, new species are said to not be welcomed to the sanctuary and future energy would be heavily affected.
         Even if this impacts on us humans as in future energy and not having any new species invited to the sanctuary on the other hand there are still benefits that can help us and are able to make us expand as humans. The future takeaway from this Sanctuary will have an effect on the future generations to have an historical place where culture of the Chumash on the coastline with stories that impact the Chumash and also me as a Californian to be informed and learn about our coastline history.
       I truly would love having Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary on the coastline that will be dedicated to the first people in our area. I am all for it if this Sanctuary is permitted with the intent to help, expand, and protect the environment. 

Sincerely,
        Andres Diaz

Having the largest possible boundary and a Tribal Collaborative Management is an impactful way to honor the Indigenous people of the central coast.

I have been stuck living in Lafayette, CA for many years, but for the first 18 years of my life I was raised alongside the Pacific Ocean. To me, the ocean has always been an elder, a place of reverence and a place long needing our protection. 
I was at the shoreline as an infant and all throughout my childhood, I still go there to feel a sense of home.  It constantly breaks my heart to witness its pollution as the Bay Area is so wrought with devastation to maintain elitist agendas.  

When I go to the coast, I walk, observe, and appreciate while I can mostly because I can only even access it while I’m working on my lunch break.  Due to poverty getting there otherwise is not possible.  It has been made to be for those who are wealthy instead of for all who care for it, which particularly disgusts me.  Development of our coasts is absolutely in part responsible for the effects of the many climate catastrophes we are seeing today.  These are some of the most precious and vulnerable areas of our ecosystem.
The ocean is personally important to me. We depend on the ocean for recreation, our spiritual well-being, our community connections, and our economic health.
I want to protect this stretch of ocean so my community can continue to connect with and benefit from a clean, safe, and healthy ocean.
The ocean is beautiful and mysterious. There is so much we’ve learned from it and much more to be learned. A sanctuary will be an important part of ocean research and education for present and future generations.

Her only decision was get paid for her claims or not. 
Here I am anyway, writing to ask that you preserve the Morro Bay section of the proposed Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, and that you adopt the entire proposal as a marine sanctuary. I’m not going to bore you with the reasons. You know what they are. 
How tragic this Wind Turbine project is the reason for the Morro Bay exclusion from the sanctuary. Tragic that in the name of clean, green energy, this project will turn Morro Bay’s intact and thriving marine life and its surrounding communities into an industrial site for surveying, construction, and ongoing maintenance.
Morro Bay was of course part of Marine Sanctuary corridor. It’s essential. It wasn’t until rights were sold for millions to build wind turbines. Only energy departments and city planners want these wind turbines, and unfortunately you and they hold all the power in these decisions.
People don’t want this. It seems inevitable that it will impact, if not devastate whale migrations and all the marine life that surrounds them. Pause please and look to mistakes we’ve made in the past. Please consider adopting the Marine Sanctuary with the Morro Bay section intact. Don’t risk destroying ocean life along the Pacific Coast.

I am a resident of Goleta, CA. I strongly support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the largest boundary that is contiguous with other National Marine Sancutaries. I support including the approximately 2,000 square miles that were part of the initial proposal, but eliminated as part of the latest agency proposal. Adding this area would connect the southern end of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary with the northern border of the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary. Connecting these two important marine protected areas will maximize protections for wildlife, habitats, and waters that make the central coast of California so special. It would follow scientific studies that demonstrate the importance of marine wildlife corridors for migratory species. It would also add back in sensitive cultural sites. I also support including the ""Gaviota extension"" as proposed in the Draft EIS. As you finalize a management plan and regulations for the new sanctuary, I recommend and support preventing new offshore oil and gas development in the sanctuary, prohibiting fracking and acidizing activities in the sanctuary, including water quality programs to prevent land-based pollution into sanctuary waters, adding strong measures related to speed of large vessels transiting the sanctuary, reducing pollution from large vessels, and making sure proactive, collaborative management is undertaken with Indigenous peoples.

I may live in Santa Cruz, but to me the designation is crucial as it sets aside a large swath of the coast under indigenous leadership and helps protect some of California’s most important surf ecosystems.

I have known Violet Sage-Walker for a few years now and have witnessed her determination, grit and resolve to realize a multi-generational dream; to get the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary designated as the first indigenous-led marine sanctuary. I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes: 
The Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary (CHNMS) name is important. It is meant to recognize people that have lived on this coast for over 10,000 years; protect the heritage of the Chumash, an ocean-going band among the First People of the Pacific Coast; and provide a timely and appropriate reminder of the cultural origins. I support equitable inclusion of all Central Coast Tribes, both federally and non-federally recognized Tribes, in collaborative management.
It is vital that Sanctuary education and community outreach should partner with area schools to share information about sanctuary species and habitats and Chumash history and culture. Outreach should be multilingual, culturally relevant, and should focus on underserved communities.
I support regulations to protect Rodriguez Seamount. The seamount provides critical habitat for an extremely diverse and abundant array of marine life and deserves to be granted strong and permanent protection. The seamount has special national significance that warrants special protections through sanctuary designation. Once damaged, fragile seamount ecosystems may not recover in our lifetime.
The proposed CHNMS will help protect important surf and cultural sites in perpetuity, therefore I support the Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension as advocated by the Tribal Council.

Again, I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the CHNMS to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

Nik Strong-Cvetich

My name is Dante Billie and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I live in Alhambra, CA and to me, the ocean is a sacred place of cultural patrimony and site of biodiversity that must be protected by the people who best know how to care for the land and have ecological knowledge and systems already in place to do so- these people being the Chumash. There is so much to gain from a healthy coast as the ocean is a place that promotes wellbeing through recreation, social connection, community, and as a site of cultural patrimony directly allowing people to practice their cultures and religions. 


I want to protect this stretch of ocean so my community can continue to connect with and benefit from a clean, safe, and healthy ocean.
The ocean is beautiful and mysterious. There is so much we’ve learned from it and much more to be learned. Both as a site for the continuation of culture and as a site for the study of unique and protected biodiversity a sanctuary will be an important part of ocean research and education for present and future generations.


I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes: 

Biggest Possible Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension
Sanctuary Name: The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”
Tribal Collaborative Management: An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management.

My, name is Karen Arrona and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Santuary with the initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extention . This will include about 7,600 square miles of ocean intended to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I live in San Luis Obispo, CA and have lived here since I was a young child (64 years). My father was a marine biologist and a professor at Cal Poly. He led field trips for the community to the Hazard Canyon tide pools and participated in summer programs for elementary age students from the San Joaquin Valley as well as doing research. I remember going to various beaches in the county all during my childhood with my dad and learning about the marine environment. My own children enjoyed these activities as well.

We need to protect the ocean so the community can benefit from a clean, safe and healthy ocean and continue to have recreational activities such as wh, swimming, surfing, kayaking and  educational activities such as whale watching.

I request that the designation of the marine sanctuary include the initial boundary alternative with the Gaviota Coast Extension and I would support adding the Salinan name to the Sanctuary since part of the proposed area includes territories inhabited by the Salinan native people. I feel that the name Chumash/Salinan Heritage National Sanctuary would be appropriate to provide an equitable approach in collaborative management. There should be outreach,education and research programs providing traditional ecological knowledge and access for underserved communities. The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity. New oil and gas development should be prohibited within sanctuary boundaries to prevent ecological disasters like we have had in the past.

I support the designation of this marine sanctuary as the best way to protect our coastal waters and diverse habitat and urge the Administration to designate this sanctuary for future generations to enjoy.

My name is Kort Alexander and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.
I spent two years on the central California coast completing a master’s degree in coastal marine resources management at the Bren School at UCSB, and there I saw how important the ocean is to the region’s economy and overall well-being. I visited the Channel Islands NMS and saw how much the NMS designation has benefited that area, and I believe the Chumash Heritage NMS could be just as successful. The marine environment is incredibly special to me, which is why I am dedicating my career to marine science and conservation. Designating the Chumash Heritage NMS would be a huge boost to tourism in central California and a huge step forward in protecting the region’s abundance of marine resources, both biological and cultural.

Furthermore, I ask that this sanctuary includes:
* Biggest Possible Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension
* Sanctuary Name: The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”
* Tribal Collaborative Management: An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management.
* Outreach & Education: Outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities
* Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity
* Ban Oil & Gas: A prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries

My name is Daniela Schulman, and I am a climate and clean energy policy advocate living in Santa Barbara, CA. Today I am writing in my individual capacity to support the swiftest possible designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension. Below I offer three suggestions for the final rule:

1. Establish a Tribal advisory council that includes all local Tribal groups, not just federally recognized Tribes, and extends membership and input opportunities to community members outside the governing bodies. Elevate Traditional Ecological Knowledge in the education and management of the Sanctuary. Respect Tribal rights to sovereignty and determination by pursuing as many genuine opportunities for collaborative management as possible.

2. Prohibit oil and gas infrastructure within Sanctuary boundaries to address the climate crisis and protect local cultural resources and marine biodiversity. To avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis, NOAA should do everything in its power to facilitate a swift phaseout of fossil fuels and transition to a zero-carbon economy, consistent with our national and state climate and clean energy targets and based on the best available science.

3. Designate the largest possible boundary alternative that ensures an equitable and expeditious path forward for the development of floating offshore wind. I urge NOAA to approve the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Extension and immediately, proactively pursue a special use permit for undersea transmission cables to pass through the Sanctuary. Submarine cables already run through Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary and could serve as a model. NOAA and California state agencies should also make use of all available funds to research the marine biodiversity impacts of offshore wind and associated transmission off of the Central Coast to ensure responsible siting that avoids, minimizes, and mitigates impacts.

Thank you for your efforts to undertake this EIS, and for your review of these comments. Please consider designating the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension.

Sincerely,
Daniela Schulman",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/NOAA-NOS-2021-0080-3071/attachment_1.pdf","pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

My name is Ember Layne Harness and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.
I live in Visalia, California and to me, the ocean of the central coast is the ocean I visit with my family. It’s the ocean that I love. I even named my beta fish “Ocean.” I think that you should make the marine sanctuary because I think animals protect us and I think in return we should protect them. The beach is one of my favorite places and I love to play in the ocean. I want the ocean to be clean for me and the animals.
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes covering as much of the coast as possible by using the Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension, that it should be called Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, that it should have Tribal Collaborative Management, that there should be educational programs to teach me and my family traditional ecological knowledge to better take care of our beautiful ocean, that it should be protected by the Rodriguez Seamount to protect the many different types of animal life that live there, and that new oil and gas development should not happen here.
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures and gifts.

It is a healthy place to be.  The air is better than it is in inland Los Angeles.   It is often but not always cleaner than the sidewalks and parkways of my neighborhood, a mile from the ocean.  
Oil spills are catastrophic and as humans its out job to protect the ocean from them.  It is wrong to assume that the ocean’s ability to survive is infinite.  As Former Congressman Leon Panetta tells us in his LA Times piece,“we wrongly assume [the ocean’s] bounty and capacity to absorb waste are limitless.  And the recent oil spill off Huntington Beach is an alarm we cannot ignore — the health of our coast and the wildlife, people and economies that depend on it cannot continue to absorb these avoidable catastrophes.”  See https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-10-22/oil-spills-marine-sanctuary-northern-chumash.  Congressman Panetta has extensive background in policymaking related to ocean protection,  so when he expresses an opinion, I listen.  He has concluded that the time is right to create a new sanctuary in California, this time in partnership with tribal communities.  
Former Northern Chumash Tribal Council Chair Fred Collins, community members in San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties have fought a multiyear campaign to create a sanctuary. Tribal Council Chair Collins died before his dream could be realized.  Nonetheless the need for the sanctuary continues.  It would protect an area targeted for offshore oil and gas development.  It is an area that contains Chumash cultural and sacred sites as well as sensitive ocean habitats. “Sanctuary designation would advance ecosystem-based planning to protect fisheries, seabirds, marine mammals, estuaries and beaches and promote appropriately sited offshore wind energy.”  See LA Times Op-Ed, above.  
Consider the alternative: A significant oil spill in this area would threaten a major portion of California’s shoreline, putting at risk nearly half the state’s coastal waters and beaches. Id. 
Thank you for your consideration.

Dear Paul Michael,

My name is Eric Roldan and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sactuary with the initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I live in the city of Oxnard in California and to me, the ocean means so much to me since we are close to it. As a kid I always went to beach, one summer I went to the beach almost every day and to me it means a lot that it gets protected. I have also done a few beach clean ups as community service with a few programs that care about the environment too. Having a orginazation that will protect the coast line will make me and other people happy.

Other people might say we shouldn’t have the orginazation because they don’t have the perspective of a beach and ocean lover. They just use the perspective of using all the materials the ocean has in order for us to be happy but not the species of animals that live there that would be affected by it. They want the oil that it has but with this orginization it’s going to ban the oil and gas facilities there. So we should support the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary because it will help out the animals and habitats they have there.

RE: Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary designation (NOAA-NOS-2021-0080)

We strongly support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary (CHNMS) to protect ocean biodiversity and to advance environmental justice through collaborative ocean management. We support the following actions:

Sanctuary Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension
Name: The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”
Tribal Collaborative Management: An inclusive approach to all Tribes in Collaborative Management & a NOAA Tribal Liaison.
Outreach and Education: Outreach, education and research programs that elevate Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities.
Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount
Offshore Wind: Thoughtful planning of Offshore Wind farms to protect ocean life
Water Quality: A prohibition on new oil development within sanctuary boundaries.

The Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, spanning over 7,500 square miles of ocean and 156 miles of coastline, will be both beneficial for the environment, local communities and the economy. 

It is vital that the CHNMS cover the largest possible contiguous boundaries. We support designation of the Initial Boundary Alternative with the Gaviota Coast Extension (Sub-Alt 5b). Including the waters offshore Point Buchon, Morro Bay, Cayucos, and Cambria will close the California Central Coast’s biodiversity protection gap between Monterey Bay and Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuaries. This will protect the only eelgrass bed in a 300-mile stretch of coast; many historic Chumash sites, including Lisamu’ (Morro Rock); numerous protected marine mammals and shorebirds; the highest population of Southern Sea otters on the California coast; several State Marine Conservation Areas; and the kelp forests and rocky intertidal habitats considered to be some of the most diverse and abundant in the world.

The Draft Environmental Impact Statement acknowledges that all other alternatives would reduce the significant beneficial effects on biological resources provided by the Initial Boundary Alternative. All other alternatives would increase the vulnerability of those resources to adverse impacts that the Initial Boundary Alternative would prohibit or mitigate. The Initial Boundary Alternative is expected to result in long-term beneficial impacts on local residents (including low-income and minority populations), as well as on the health and well-being of children.

We support equitable inclusion of all Central Coast Tribes in collaborative management. All sanctuary stakeholders will benefit from Indigenous input. The CHNMS is an opportunity to advance environmental justice efforts. Equitable collaborative management must be open to all Tribal groups interested in participating. This can best be accomplished with a Tribal Sanctuary Advisory Council made up of interested Tribal Groups. NOAA’s Tribal collaboration should be facilitated by a qualified Tribal Liaison.

Sanctuary education and community outreach should partner with area schools to increase education and access to the ocean for local communities. Programs should focus on both ocean ecology and Tribal history and culture. Outreach should be multilingual and multicultural, and prioritize underserved communities, such as the inland communities of Guadalupe and Santa Maria. We urge development of research programs that address the impacts of climate change, encourage community science, and elevate the use of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) to enhance ecosystem-based management. The Sanctuary should teach the benefits of protecting our ocean and planet and promote the spirit of stewardship that is exemplified by the culture and history of the original Chumash caretakers.

We support regulations to protect Rodriguez Seamount. The seamount provides critical habitat for extremely biodiverse marine life that needs strong and permanent protection against damaging activities such as deep sea mining and other threats. The seamount has special national significance that warrants special protections through sanctuary designation. Once damaged, fragile seamount ecosystems may not recover in our lifetime.

While a source of renewable energy, Offshore Wind (OSW) farms will have environmental impacts on habitat, wildlife, and water quality. California’s first OSW projects adjacent to the sanctuary should be planned and sited to avoid or mitigate impacts to sensitive marine areas and species and important cultural resources. The National Marine Sanctuary Program should work closely with state and federal partners, OSW companies, Tribes, and community members to ensure future OSW is developed in the most environmentally and culturally responsible manner.

Please act to protect our coasts via the Initial Proposal for the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary.

I believe that if we have all of the waters protected it will be bad for research and being able to figure out if the marine sanctuaries continue to work.

I do not speak for Pacific Wildlife Care (PWC), but I am a current President of that organization serving San Luis Obispo County, I also have been a volunteer since 2005 for the Hi Mountain Condor Lookout, helping to train Cal Poly interns for work with the CA Condor Recovery Program. I was in Santa Barbara during the '69 oil spill. PWC as an organization began by citizens involved responding to an oil spill in Avila Beach.  I have joined the Oiled Wildlife Care Network through PWC and received many response trainings.  I have supported many environmental issues in San Luis Obispo County since moving here in 1970, including the successful protests of a supertanker port in Estero Bay.

I strongly support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the original Boundary Alternative to protect biodiversity and habitats joined to the Monterey Sanctuary in the north. I live in Cambria and our Pacific Ocean which is within a  mile of me and I take my grandchildren to the beach whenever they visit.

 I understand the removal off Morro Bay is due to the leases for wind farms...I am just now learning that there is a growing number of SLO County folks who are beginning to organize and will rally our citizens to oppose this move.  The environmental impacts, the effectiveness of wind are unknowns at this point in time. I have recently attended two USGS talks about the MOTUS at Piedras Blancas and tracking along the coast (migratroy birds and bats) as they BEGIN to gather data (that is far from complete).  I was surprised to learn that none of the obvious environmental concerns for whales, marine mammals, pelagic birds, migratory birds has been considered prior to the granting of leases. To me this is an obvious cart before the horse situation!  In my lifetime, there have now been 3 major/catastrophic cart-before-horse events:  Thalidamide, Fen-Fen, Opioids.. It's always hard to put the genie back in the bottle, but our oceans are fragile, our marine life important and vital. We need to STOP and really analyze everything BEFORE we ruin more of our planet and resources. Morro Bay itself thrives on Tourism (as does my town and we already have the impacts of Highway One being closed for so long!)

 It's my opinion that we need to connect the whole Pacific Coast between the Monterey Marine Sanctuary and the Channel Islands Marine Sanctuary in order to maintain our natural beauty and reduce any harmful impacts to the ocean, the seashore, the communities along our coast. Anything less is not only risky but a shameful way to protect our CA Coast (a treasure)!",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

My name is Lucy Gill, and I am a recent graduate of UC Berkeley’s doctoral program in Anthropology now living in Oakland, California. I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I am an archaeologist with experience working in cultural resource management throughout California. Archaeological research complements Indigenous oral records in demonstrating that Indigenous Californians have been sustainably managing California’s diverse marine ecosystems for millennia. Additionally, because of the state-sanctioned genocide experienced by Native Californians, which resulted in the destruction of many sacred places, the government has a responsibility to protect sacred places like Lisamu’ (Morro Rock) and the entirety of Morro Bay, which was the center of Chumash commerce and community and holds significance for many different Tribal communities. 

I ask that this sanctuary incorporates the largest possible boundary (the Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension), the only plan sufficient for protecting one of the most biodiverse ecosystems in the world and protecting Chumash and other Tribal sacred places. It should be collaboratively and equitably managed by all Tribes, prioritizing Traditional Ecological Knowledge in outreach, education, and research, which is essential for sustainable management, especially in this time of anthropogenic climate change. I also support a complete prohibition on new oil and gas development within sanctuary boundaries, which would be in direct opposition towards protecting this sensitive ecosystem and promoting a sustainable future for California.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

The designation can be very important and crucial. Not only in preserving, and protecting marine life, but also in preserving the historical site used by the Chumash. The proposed sanctuary would come with long-term protection and management to reduce threats that would adversely affect their historical, cultural, archaeological, recreational, and educational value. In the designation there are also possible historical sites within, mainly being shipwrecks. 

I live in Oxnard, California and the ocean is a big part of our society and identity. Especially being so close to the coast, I have a deep appreciation for the marine life here. I grew up fishing with my dad and he would always teach me about marine life in the Channel islands. I loved watching dolphins go by the boat, seeing sea lions laying on the docks. The certain occasions where we would hear whales. The things I have experienced I would want for other kids and younger generations to be able to experience as well. 

Not to mention, there are also oil rigs that are harming our ocean and risking endangered animals in the ocean. This designation would help protect all of these marine animals. Many threatened or endangered species, such as blue whales, snowy plovers, black abalone, white sharks, and leatherback sea turtles, rely on habitats, or prey found in the proposed sanctuary. Without these, the animals have a chance to go extinct. 

However, in the area of the designation, California is proposing an ambitious goal to get 100% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2045. To do this they have been wanting to build wind farms in the area of the designation. This is a good thing, increasing in more renewable sources, though it’s an ambitious plan. These wind turbines can be harmful to marine life and habitats in the area. I believe that it would be better to find a different area to build these turbines, and have the designation go through for scientific and preversing purposes. 

I fully support this designation, because it’s highly beneficial and important to our society.

Makayla Nguyen

My name is Angela Hanglow and I am writing in support of designating the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to include the Initial Boundary Alternative as well as the Gaviota Coast Extension to protect its wonderful biodiversity and habitats. I specifically wish for the area between Morro Bay and Cambria to be included in the designation.
I have had a second home in Morro Bay for almost 20 years and visit monthly and to me, the area is a refugee and oasis for the spirit.  My two sons grew up visiting the area and one is now at U.C. Berkeley Law school learning how to protect the environment inspired by his formative years on the central coast and of course Morro Bay’s sea otters. 
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes the area between Morro Bay and Cambria.  I am a supporter of alternative energy and the area’s wind farm plans.  However, I believe that the Tribal Collaborative Management can and should be the negotiators seeing this project through.  In addition, I support a prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries.
Thank you,
Sincerely
Angela Hanglow

Dear NOAA,
I am a marine biologist PhD student at Stanford University and resident of Moss beach, California writing in strong support of the INITIAL boundary alternative.

The Initial Boundary Alternative represents the boundary option in the original sanctuary nomination and is the sole alternative that assures contiguous protections of our coastal and offshore waters. It also ensures that offshore development is subject to the same regulatory protections for wildlife and habitat that apply to other parts of the sanctuary. I support the responsible development of green energy alternatives, including potential offshore industrial installations for wind and wave energy, but feel that rigorous assessment is needed for permits or authorizations, to ensure that any activities carried out have a justified environmental impact and impact to fisheries. 

I also think it is important to keep in mind the funding mechanisms behind different agencies who have interest in developing the coastline. If a private interest requests a permit/authorization to work within the proposed boundary, it is important that the financial burden of denying this appeal or engaging in legal action is held by the corporation that is applying, not the marine sanctuary. The initial boundary alternative is the only alternative that gives full power and financial safety to the stewards and managers of the sanctuary to carry out necessary assessment and then approve or reject development proposals within its waters. 

The California coast has been meaningful to me and my family as a place of rest and harvesting and connection. This comment is for myself and for them, and for my future children and neighbors so that we can together ensure that power is concentrated in the right places, helping to enforce decisions to steward our coastline in a way that helps humans and non humans of the area to thrive together. 

Many thanks for your time,

I am a lifelong Californian, and I support the full designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension. As a resident of the San Mateo County coast, I am exceptionally fortunate to have daily access to the Pacific Ocean. Each time we stroll our local beach, we look for - and collect - debris and trash, in an effort to keep our local state beach as clean as we can. 

I cannot think of a more important or relevant effort than to approve the full Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, with the boundary alternative and Gaviota Extension. The Sanctuary will undoubtedly be an important element of ocean research, and a truly unique opportunity for education and environmental awareness.

As part of my enthusiastic support for the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, I ask that:
It is comprised of the Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension.
The sanctuary is named the “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”.
It reflects an equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management.
It emphasizes outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge and access for local underserved communities.
It includes protection of Rodriguez Seamount, which is essential to protect biodiversity.
And that there is a prohibition on new oil and gas development within the sanctuary boundaries.

Thank you for taking my comments into consideration, and thank you and your team for making the right choice to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary in the most robust and full capacity as possible. - Kathleen McCartney",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

I AM STRONGLY AGAINST THE INCLUSION OF WIND TURBINES and associated CABLES in Morro Bay.  The disruption of the seafloor and underlying seabed, in these LARGELY UNEXPLORED, AND UNKNOWN, FRAGILE MARINE ENVIRONMENTS, the long-term  effects of which
are unknown, are sufficient to prompt the Monterey Bay Aquarium to call for a 'pause' on undersea mining and exploration, until the impacts of such disruptions can be more fully elucidated.  Construction of these massive structures is similar in its destructive effects on the seafloor. THERE IS ALREADY KNOWN HARM BEING CAUSED TO MARINE MAMMALS BY THE PRESENCE OF OFFSHORE WIND FARMS, AND, AS SUCH THEY HAVE NO PLACE IN AN AREA THAT PURPORTS TO PRESERVE MARINE LIFE!!
I also object to the inclusion of such structures being 'permitted' in the event the Initial Boundary limits survive to implementation.  THE BLASTING, DRILLING AND CONSTANT MECHANICAL HUM OF THESE MASSIVE STRUCTURES, not to mention their EVENTUAL REMOVAL, HAVE NO PLACE IN A SANCTUARY.  The idea that the destructive effects and commotion will be restricted to the narrow corridor, in a marine environment, is ludicrous!!! 
IN ADDITION, THE HARM TO MIGRATING BIRDS AND OBSTRUCTION OF MARINE MAMMAL MIGRATION ROUTES, as well as the BLIGHT to the seascape makes wind turbines of MORE HARM THAN BENEFIT.  In contrast, the ongoing operation of the Diablo Nuclear Power Plant: ""Unlike evaporative cooling systems used at other plants, Diablo Canyon's OTC is designed so all water can be recycled, and to assure minimal impact on ocean ecosystems. Reactors can be throttled back during heavy storm surges to prevent an excess of kelp from entering the cooling water intake, and power is limited during operation"" (Wikipedia quote), the warmed water returned to the ocean SUPPORTS THRIVING MARINE LIFE, and Diablo's presence in the Sanctuary area
should prove to be of benefit, in contrast to the KNOWN HARMFUL EFFECTS OF OFFSHORE WIND FARMS!!!!!",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

My name is Ricardo and I support the chumash heritage national marine sanctuary with the initial boundary alternative and Gaviota Coast Extensions to cover around 7,600 square miles of ocean this was proposed to protect the wildlife and living habitats in this area.
I live in Oxnard California and to me this ocean is very beautiful and relaxing.
When I go out to the coast I normally just go with my family and friends to walk on the beach or just watch the wildlife and look out into the open ocean. I want to protect this ocean so that the wildlife that live there can flourish and live happily in their home and continue to stay where they are on our coast. The ocean is a very vast area that we should preserve and explore, and keep nice so our next generation can come out and see the ocean and experience this just as we have. 
I support the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary and i  ask that this sanctuary includes: 
A Nice Sanctuary name: something that matches with the area. 
Education: Lots of educational opportunities and programs to teach people about the sanctuary and the history of the chumash.
No oil rigs: No oil rigs near the sanctuary because the oil could destroy the wildlife and pollute the waters
I support the designation of the Chumash heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow the current and future generations to enjoy. Protect and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

As a guest and settler in Santa Barbara County, I have been welcomed with open arms by the Chumash bands that have thrived here for millennia and continue to do so. I know that this designation is a crucial step in affirming Chumash sovereignty and autonomy, creating a regenerative, healing, and accountable society, and also doing our part as allies and settlers in this space. I commend you for working on this effort, but also call on you to do so much more. I urge you to include the waters from Cambria south to Point Buchon and Montaña de Oro State Park, included in the original Sanctuary boundaries, in the actual Sanctuary. We must do this Marine Sanctuary correctly and authentically. Not including these waters is another example of settlers disregarding Indigenous voices and needs, and places us further away from equitable coexistence. I urge you to add these waters to do your part as an accountable ally and to set precedence for more amazing and healing designations like these. Thank you so much for your time and consideration; I greatly appreciate it!

Dear Paul Michel,
My name is Suzanne Iudicello Martley and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.
Although I now live as far away from either coast as can be — in Rapid City, South Dakota, about 50 miles from the North American pole of inaccessibility — my career of 50 years has been on the coasts, for the ocean, for fishers, for fish and all ocean species. Truth to tell, I’ve been a contractor to NOAA for technical support for decades, including projects related to marine reserves and national marine sanctuaries.*
My time on the coast is constrained these days to business trips, but I always take some extra time after the work to walk on the beach, watch wildlife, wade in the surf, and restore my well-being. 
This sanctuary will be an important part of those qualities, but also recreation, community connections, economic sustainability and new opportunities, ocean research and education for present and future generations. More than that, it can be an example of how to respect, integrate, and co-manage sacred sites.
In my current geography and work, the preservation of tribal access to plants, animals, and sacred sites in the Black Hills is actually relevant to your designation. Protection of the Rapid Creek Watershed that sustains our community and others in Western South Dakota is another tough bargain: how do we choose natural resources that provide clean energy when those activities conflict with sustaining and conserving clean water, healthy communities, economic activity in the outdoor recreation sector, and access to lands and resources by the indigenous people from whom these lands and waters were taken? We are currently fighting the unregulated, unpermitted exploration and proposed development of lithium for car batteries in the watershed that is Mní Wičóni: Water is Life.
Because of my career-long work to protect the ocean and its inhabitants, and because NOAA has this opportunity to show that co-management and restoration of tribal rights can work, I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. 
Please designate boundaries that include:
•	The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension.
•	The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary.”
•	An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management.
•	Outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities.
•	The protection of Rodriguez to protect biodiversity.
•	A prohibition on new oil and gas development within sanctuary boundaries.
This area should be a sanctuary, “a place of refuge or safety” according to the dictionary, not a conflict zone of strife and threats to sea life. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.
With respect,
Suzanne Iudicello Martley

Our Monterey harbor depends on us liveaboards to alert them of loose vessels, illegal oil spills excreta. We are a valuable assets and save our Harbor office much money to hire full time employees to comb the harbor 24 hours a day looking for violations or loose vessels.
Also it is unreasonable to ask a person to die on their ship because it went aground and they cannot leave the ship. Sometimes you must desert due to whatever circumstances threaten your life. This must be clarified.
(7) Deserting a vessel aground, at anchor, or adrift in the Sanctuary or leaving harmful matter aboard a grounded or deserted vessel in the Sanctuary.
Wind farms on the ocean will kill millions of seabirds who also use the wind patterns that these wind farms seek. Therefore may I suggest only allowing wave energy farms be used such as VOIT Systems as depicted in this YouTube Video. There are many different wave energy systems to choose from but allowing wind farms on the surface of the ocean should not be allowed for the reasons mentioned.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcStpg3i5V8&t=33s

I live in Oxnard, CA and to me,  the ocean is a really beautiful thing to me. The view when it’s in front of me while sitting on the sand or  the huge rocks. You never know what you can find inside the ocean. It's full of unique animals and plants and so many other things we haven’t discovered yet. The ocean can have big waves or  small waves. The sound of the waves is really peaceful for me. I have so many great memories from  my childhood and even now that are made next to the ocean. 

 I ask that this sanctuary includes educating the audience about the culture and the history. Letting people know how this project means to them and how it will impact their lives. What led to them deciding to do this project.  The possibility of recovering declining species to the ocean. Stopping oil companies from taking advantage  of the ocean.

I lived in San Luis Obispo for 7 years before recently moving to the Pacific Northwest. I fell in love with the central coast while living in San Luis Obispo. The beaches I frequented were a place of relaxation and peace, and allowed me to connect to nature. I loved kayaking, swimming, walking on the beaches, and tidepooling. The health of the ocean is deeply important to me personally. I also work in the marine fisheries field, and have seen firsthand how much humans have impacted our oceans. We need to protect these areas as soon as possible to preserve them for future generations. The best time to act is now.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes: 

Biggest Possible Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension
Sanctuary Name: The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”
Tribal Collaborative Management: An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management.
Outreach & Education: Outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities
Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity
Ban Oil & Gas: A prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries

I strongly support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

My name is Gary Bauer and I have been a SLO County resident since 1996.   I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary (CHNMS) with the Initial Boundary Alternative that includes Morro Bay and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I love living on the Central Coast and love the outdoors. It is one of my favorite things about living on the unspoiled Central Coast.

I support the designation of the CHNMS because it would help protect and keep our oceans and its species safe and healthy.

This is vital to the economic and physical health of the coastline.  Not only have the Chumash protected this area for hundreds of years, but our current population relies on a healthy coastline for its survival as a working coastal town and the tourist dollars that support many of our local shop owners.  The Morro Bay community is home to a world renowned annual Bird Festival, natural history museum, and  whale watching industry.  The survival of our community depends on a coastline free of wind turbines, oil drilling, and deep sea mining.  Sanctuary status would protect the coastline's health for generations to come from willy-nilly decisions made by rotating officials.  I feel very strongly that we need to protect our marine life.  I realize the government wants to find ways to produce power and harvest resources, but there are less sensitive areas to do so that will not impact a local population dedicated to and dependent upon a healthy coastline.

My name is Johaly, I am a student from Pacifica High School, I live in Oxnard, California, and I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary.  My relationship with the ocean is where I and my family can relax and make memories. The ocean is also a beautiful place to visit and watch the sunset, but the ocean is important to me because there are sea creatures in the ocean, and there are so many things we don't know about.
My reasoning for why I support this Sanctuary is because it will provide protection to special resources in the area and keep our coast safe. 
The scientific evidence is that this sanctuary the Chumash will be involved in taking care of the coast like the kelp forest, sea otters, migratory whales, and the marine life on the coast so it will be in good hands. 
No impact would affect me, for other people it might be that the site can’t be used for renewable energy and oil.
An opposing view is that others might disagree because they believe there are other ways to protect marine areas and believe there should not be additional limitations. But I'm afraid I have to disagree because this can be for a good cause, we are losing so many animals in the sea, this can protect them from any litter, this may help our coast to be healthy. 
I hope this sanctuary can help the animals keep our coast in good condition and be away from any sources that are bad for the coast. I hope that this sanctuary will be useful to the tribes and to be equal, and I hope these tribes will protect our coast.  
To sum up, I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow our coast to be safe and for future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our coasts.

My name is Bob Thawley and I support the rapid designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats, and create a lasting legacy of protection for our children.

I live in San Francisco, CA,  but have spent substantial time over the years on that coastline, diving and fishing in my youth and now just appreciating the natural beauty with family. 

This sanctuary should have biggest possible boundary and again, please support the Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension to be named “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”, in honor of the original people of theses lands and  should include all Tribes in Collaborative Management.
This stewardship would help support outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities. The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity, as is a prohibition on new oil and gas development within sanctuary boundaries. Additionally, please oppose the proposed offshore wind projects off of Vandenberg based on serious environmental, cultural and permitting-process issues. The projects are irresponsibly sited too close to the shore, in a uniquely biodiverse location, with highly significant fisheries and unacceptable impacts to critical cultural sites for the Chumash and other native peoples. We should be ensuring a contiguous buffer of ocean protection while directing Offshore Wind development to more suitable areas further offshore where wind energy is optimal and ecological and cultural impacts can be reduced.  Any
Offshore Wind transmission cables proposed for this area as part of future offshore wind
development should require permits from the National Marine Sanctuary Program to ensure that
they are planned and sited in a thoughtful, consolidated manner to reduce and mitigate impacts to
the ocean. 

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s bounty and healing power, as well as to honor and benefit from the traditional Indigenous knowledge that Chumash stewardship would bring to our future as Californians.

NOAA.  I support the formation of the Chumash Heritage NMS!  Originally proposed to fill the gap between the Monterey Bay and 

Channel Islands NMS, it would support and protect our ocean and our California shoreline, and honor the Indigenous people whose 

ancestors have cared for it from the beginning.

I do NOT support the proposed carve out of Morro Bay, which is poised to receive our first of at least 3 separate wind farms. 

Consequently, this city, as well as SLO County, is hiring experts to help them plan because this technology is so advanced.  We need this 

Chumash Heritage NMS more than ever to be among the local stakeholders overseeing development of wind energy production in our 

neighborhood.  

I think that, had the new NMS been in place sooner , NOAA would have had to approach the sanctuary expecting (and hoping) they 

would be accommodated with good will.  What will happen on the ocean floor when cables are laid and turbines are placed is mostly 

unknown.  Locals, stakeholders of all kinds, will be supportive and engaged when they are included in the process!  Thank you.

My name is Ali Chacon and I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats. 
I live in Oxnard, CA and to me, the ocean is a wonderful place where ancestors traveled across to bring our people to new lands. Where most stories took place, and where they will continue to be told. The ocean is filled with creatures of the sea and land. It's a special place for me, and a special home for them. 

When I go to the coast,  I can hear the ocean waves crash onto the rocks. My family and I would go on trips to places far away, and so my dad would always take the route that's near the ocean on the other side of the mountains. I can see the big waves crash on the shore, seagulls flying over the sea, tides coming… Everything was beautiful to see. The smell too, it reminds me of my childhood so much of when I came in contact with the sand, water, shells.. Everything.

The ocean is personally important to me because this is where my native ancestors started. They lived near the ocean and came from islands. It brings back memories because I would always help my Native tribe with beach and ocean cleanups. It gave me a good connection with the ocean, and it had been a while since i've been in the ocean.
I want to protect the ocean for the sake of the ocean’s sea animals. They live in those waters and shouldn't have to leave or worse.. Die because of our causes. I want more people to realize that we are hurting our beautiful ocean, and that we should do something to protect our waters. We want this part of the ocean to be here for a long time, for future generations to see how far the world has come and what we did to save it. 

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes: Native culture of the Chumash people. It would be nice since this would be a sanctuary in their name, and we can listen to the stories they would want to share dedicated to the ocean and animals. It also honors them and the land that we stand on. I would also hope to see Tribal Collaborative Management. It would mean the world to me knowing other tribes would want to help this good cause, and everyone coming together would create better bonding. Another is the banishment of Oil and gas near the sanctuary. I hope the sanctuary would prohibit any oils from spilling from offshore or from development areas. I did read that they will prohibit it, but with a cost of transferring pipelines and being a disturbance to the seafloor, so I'm hoping they would do something about that. Lastly, I’m hoping to see outreach and education. Seeing programs for kids to be part of or understanding the traditional ecological knowledge of the Chumash and the community. For example, elementary kids could learn about the plant life and animals of course living in the sanctuary. Highschoolers can learn the way these animals are living, what is keeping them safe, and how this affects us and the environment. But for people of all ages, they can learn the Chumash peoples' culture, traditions, and the land that we stand for. It can be an enjoyable experience for all people of different cultures, and gaining new knowledge to continue sharing.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

I live in the bay area and have spent several years of my life on the central coast and to me, the ocean is a protector of humanity by buffering and mitigating the impacts of climate change and providing beauty, food, and recreation that we must in turn protect. I go to the ocean to kayak and reconnect with my relationship to the water. 

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes:

Biggest Possible Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension
Sanctuary Name: The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”
Tribal Collaborative Management: An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management.
Outreach & Education: Outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities
Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity
Ban Oil & Gas: A prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries

My name is Lina. I am a registered nurse and I support the prompt designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. 

I live in Menlo Park, California and to me, the ocean is a beautiful connection for all of us to nature and it needs to be protected for all. 

I lived in Santa Cruz for a decade and was minutes away from the ocean. The view, the sound and the fresh air from the ocean always soothed my days. I could see it during daytime and hear it at night time in my bed. It’s helped me cope through the stressful years during the pandemic while I was at the the frontlines as a healthcare worker. 

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats. I also support the protection of Rodriguez Seamount which is essential to protect biodiversity in this area. 

I ask that this sanctuary includes the biggest possible boundary and that we can have the name Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to honor the indigenous people, and also that we focus on collaborating with the tribal members. 

I hope that we can see successful education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities. 

Please promote banning of new oil and gas development within the sanctuary boundaries to preserve this area. Already too much is lost to oil and gas destruction of nature in United States already.

This is a letter of support for the proposal with a request to extend it to meet the Monterey Bay NMS, the entry and wetlands of the entire Morro Bay, and Morro Rock.

I am thrilled that this area of the California coast is being put forward as a national marine sanctuary.  If we are going to take care of the planet and it’s life, we need to make it a priority to do so. The ocean and this area are worth protecting as a source of diversity, safe migratory paths and homes for a plethora of animals, food, oxygen, and as a carbon sink. The currents of the ocean protect and stabilize the climate of the planet, provide heat and carbon absorption, and help provide for the diversity of life critical for continued life on this planet.  

The Chumash have revered this coast line. It is important that we recognize their place here and celebrate their special connection to the ocean. I love that this sanctuary will be named to honor these people.

I do have complaints that the sanctuary does not complete a ocean highway for migrating animals, does not include ocean access to Morro Bay, does not include the Bay itself or Morro Rock.  These are aspects that should not be left out of the Sanctuary.  The fact that the area has commercial concerns and will be a necessary access point for off-short wind farms should not be an impediment to its inclusion in the sanctuary. By failing to include and protect the bay, Morro Rock, and connect this stretch of coast to the Monterey Bay NMS, NOAA is breaking up the migration highway of marine animals, leaving out a site sacred to the Chumash (Morro Rock), and failing to provide the bay the protections that will be necessary effectively protect the cultural heritage and the bird species that rely on the area. I think that’s wrong.

Please establish the Chumash Heritage NMS, connect it to the Monterey Bay NMS, and include the bay and the culturally important Morro Rock in the Sanctuary.

As a lover of the California coast, an active volunteer of the Monterey Bay Aquarium, and coastal recreation user, I am borrowing these words from the Surfrider Foundation and agree with the following points that they raise. 
“I strongly support the designation of a new national marine sanctuary off the central California coast, 
    • This designation should be named Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary in recognition of the history and culture of the Chumash people.
    • The Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary should be officially designated as soon as possible.
    • The sanctuary boundaries should include the full geographic extent reflected in the original proposal - i.e., the Initial Boundary Alternative - as well as the Gaviota Coast Extension (5B) boundary option. 
    • The management plan should ensure the lasting protection of the sanctuary’s outstanding ecological and cultural resources.
    • The sanctuary should prohibit any oil and gas exploration, development or production.
    • The sanctuary should prohibit seabed mining, ocean dumping and other activities damaging to the seafloor, cultural resources and marine ecosystem.
    • The sanctuary should protect water quality from pollution sources including cruise ships, commercial vessels and agricultural runoff.
    • Indigenous Collaborative Management should be applied in an equitable manner to empower the Chumash Nation and other Indigenous Peoples to steward these invaluable resources.
    • The sanctuary should support and promote marine research, education, stewardship, recreation and tourism.”

 My name is Jessica and I support The Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. The Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary is a collaborative effort led by the Northern Chumash Tribal Council. To fund a national marine sanctuary off the central California coast. The sanctuary would protect ocean biodiversity, and advance environmental justice through collaborative management. The sanctuary would protect thousands of years of Chumash cultural heritage by protecting sacred sites. I live in Oxnard California and to me the beach is a sacred place and it means a different thing to everyone. The beach holds an ocean full of memories and history. I learn so much about the beach, and me every time I go. I see how every animal has its own space.  Everything that makes the beach up has a beautiful story yet to be told. The beach brings me to peace and grounds me from this hectic world. The background information of The Chumash National Sanctuary states “marine environment of the proposed sanctuary is significant for its historical, archaeological, cultural, aesthetic, and biological resources. Over 200 reported ship and aircraft wrecks, with at least 20 in the sanctuary area, reflect its maritime importance. Coastal tourism, recreation, and commercial fishing drive the local economy, especially in San Luis Obispo County, while Santa Barbara County sees more coastal and offshore energy and military activities. Public access is more available in San Luis Obispo County, with military bases and private land limiting access in Santa Barbara County. Marine research is an emerging sector in the region.” The opposing side argues that the Central Coast waterways do not need to add more federal oversight. The fear he might lose local control over the water. Might disturb the local businesses that are there. Some are concerned about the economic impact. I believe that we should take the risk and help persevere such an important part of history, culture, and marine life

My name is Kirah Wilks and I fully support the proposition to create the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary in order to protect biodiversity, habitats and the water quality. 

I live in Santa Cruz, CA and I cannot begin to describe my love for the ocean. It brings me to tears knowing that so many amazing marine species have gone extinct within recent years specifically due to human activity, but we can still restore what we've lost! The ocean is the most powerful place and can easily benefit us with spiritual well-being and community connections. I want to protect the proposed 7,600 square miles of coast to ensure our communities with a clean ocean and healthy marine life. 

There's so much we know (and so much more we don't know) about our oceans, moreover we have strong evidence proving that our actions 100% affect the overall health of our ocean. Without National Marine Sanctuaries, oil-drilling would be overpopulating our oceans and propelling even faster towards a mass extinction. The Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary should include the biggest possible boundary, a ban on oil and gas development, collaborations to manage movements with Tribes, easy-to-understand educational resources/outreach programs, and finally to protect the Rodriguez Seamount to preserve biodiversity. 

The designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary has my full support, I strongly urge the Administration to appoint the possible Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to learn, benefit and protect the ocean's treasures and offerings. 

Thank you.

Sincerely, 

Kirah Wilks",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

As a descendant of first nations, Diné, I support the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary and its inclusion of Morro Rock, Lisamu.
Creative and bold gestures are remedies, first nations and the memory of the ancestors, working together in these times represent a full return to the sactity and preservation of these lands. What a historical contribution!

While the CHNMS covers only one part of the California coast, protecting it will have a chain reaction in protecting and preserving the surrounding regions. Under protection, tourists would be able to view the unique ecosystem, learn about special places such as this, and fuel the economy of the Central Coast. As stated on Chumashsanctuary.org, the CHNMS would generate “an estimated $23 million in economic activity and create 600 new jobs”.

I believe that Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary is incredibly important - because it recognizes the rightful native peoples and the importance of the ocean and the richness and diversity of life within the waters. 


I ask that you please designate the sanctuary using the initial boundaries proposed (known as the Initial Boundary Alternative), and also the Gaviota Extension (known as sub-alternative 5b). These two areas are crucial in order to provide continuous and contiguous protection between Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuaries and Monterey Bay.
The contiguous area is absolutely essential to ensure that the whole region can be protected, rather than fragmented, which will inevitably lead to degradation. 
This area contains a rich, diverse marine environment. it also contains cultural resources such as submerged historic Chumash villages.

I suggest that offshore wind transmission cables can be accommodated through a special use permit later in the process. In the meantime, it is crucial that the area and waters be permanently protected from harmful activities like the development of gas and oil; dredging,and seabed mining; and also from harmful polluting discharges to these precious and beautiful waters.

As a resident of Los Angeles and former volunteer with the Marine Mammal Care Center in San Pedro (4 years), I know from firsthand experience the value of safe passageways, open, clean seas for feeding, and shoreline for breeding and raising of Elephant seal, Harbor seal, and California sea lion pups. And, in a time of huge ecological upheaval and coming devastation from human-born climate crisis, these animals (including birds, fish, and all other marine life) need even more support in the form of protections like this for their survival.

I am writing to express my support and solidarity with the Chumash nation in the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary.

The ocean is one of our most precious natural resources, and it must be protected. I live in Isla Vista, CA, and I often go on walks by the ocean to find peace. The great majesty and beauty of the water and the life inside is overwhelming sometimes. I've started taking swimming classes, too, so that I can truly immerse myself in the ocean's glory.

That is a kind of everyday magic that we cannot sacrifice. Life itself cracked into existence on earth in the ocean. The people indigenous to this land know this best.

I deeply and sincerely hope this Marine Sanctuary rule is approved, and I hope the Chumash people are granted their rights to oversight and facilitation of the sanctuary.

Best,

As such, words cannot describe my profound love for my community and investment in its future, but I will do my best:

To me, the future of Morro Bay is inherently entwined with the ocean's health. Every aspect of life here, in one way or another, is shaped by our beautiful marine surroundings. In my case, the time I spent kayaking, tide-pooling, swimming, and boogie boarding amongst Morro Bay's marine life during my childhood was critical in determining who I wanted to be in this world. This past June, I graduated from UC San Diego with a B.S. in Marine Biology. I spent most of my undergrad researching climate mitigation solutions at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. I now work at the UCSD Center on Global Justice teaching and developing climate science curricula for middle schools in San Diego. Long term, I want to use my skills to protect and conserve marine habitats back home - I owe my deepest gratitude and admiration to the Chumash leaders who already do so, and have been for thousands of years.  

I firmly believe that the only sustainable, just, and equitable way forward for Morro Bay - and the surrounding Central Coast - is to establish the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative. It is time that we learn from past mistakes, listen to community leaders with generational knowledge, and fully commit to protecting the health of our marine ecosystems. There is inevitable loss and transformation that will unfold in Morro Bay as a result of climate change - we cannot undo the past, but we can fight for the future. I urge the NOAA to do everything in its power to protect heritage and biodiversity for generations to come.  ",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

P.O. BOX  599
MILL VALLEY, CA 94942

Good morning,

Thank you for the opportunity to support the INITIAL Boundary Alternative for the proposed Chumash Heritage NMS. As President of the Marin Audubon Society, a Mill Valley, California based chapter of the National  Audubon Society that has for over 67 years worked to conserve wildlife and wild habitats. I am writing to convey our support for the proposed Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary Boundary Alternative 1 (Initial) plus Gaviota addendum.

First, we endorse the extension of sanctuary protections to create a contiguous corridor in our country’s offshore waters. Having reviewed the boundary alternatives, Marin Audubon therefore supports the boundary alternative originally published in the Federal Register that will create an uninterrupted corridor of legal protections for significant natural and cultural resources. An automatic carve-out for offshore industrial development, including wind and wave energy installations as reflected in the “agency-preferred” alternative is not in keeping with NOAA’s Office of Marine Sanctuary’s mandate for environmental protection.

These waters support a host of protected and endangered species and their critical habitats in one of the most significant upwelling regions on the planet. This alone merits the utmost effort to maintain, conserve and restore its biological resources and habitats. Its existing proximity to offshore oil development already compromises the health of these waters, and this must prompt an extra layer of protection for the proposed marine protected area.

The  Initial/Alternative 1 Boundary ensures that offshore industrial development is subject to the same strict regulatory protections for habitat integrity and wildlife that apply to other national marine sanctuaries elsewhere and to other areas of this proposed sanctuary.  

We acknowledge that compromise is often a necessary part of achieving consensus. We also appreciate that NOAA is under the US Department of Commerce, however, we believe that commerce and conservation can work in partnership to achieve our nation’s clean energy goals. The inclusion of the Morro Bay and other areas missing from the agency-preferred option will provide a stronger framework for enforcing environmental protections as development proposals are fleshed out. The energy industry's track record - whether for carbon based fuels or otherwise - does not merit special exemptions; indeed, it warrants extra caution. In our haste to meet state and federal goals, ref: the 30/30 objectives, we should not waive our obligation to avoid, where possible, impacts in achieving them.

Please confirm the Initial Boundary Alternative for the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Barbara Salzman, President
Marin Audubon Society

My name is Rom Pico and I support the establishment of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary so that it can protect these habitats and biodiversity. I live in Oxnard, California and to me, the ocean gives me so much. It gives me a place to bond with my family, it gives me food to eat, a place to practice soccer. Whenever I go to the beach, it’s always with my family. We play volleyball or just sit there and picnic. It's really fun. Another time I go to the beach is to practice with my team, I get to be more fit due to sand being harder to run on and I get to do chilenas a lot.

I want to see how the name of this sanctuary collaborates with the Salinian tribe, as it’s their land as well so how will you share this sanctuary with them? I want to know will this Sanctuary be involved with national parks? I want to know if this Sanctuary will cost a lot of money to establish and if it will harm or benefit the California economy How will biodiversity be protected? And what will happen if this sanctuary fails? For the last time, I support this Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I really hope this succeeds as I want to see a lot of unique animals in the ocean in the future. From, Rom Pico. can you make this college leveled

Dear Paul Michel,
The Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary is a proposed marine sanctuary that would protect the region's important marine ecosystems and maritime heritage resources, support ocean-dependent economies, and preserve thousands of years of Chumash cultural heritage by protecting sacred sites. The sanctuary would stretch from Gaviota to Cambria, covering nearly 6,000 square miles of ocean. The sanctuary would prohibit oil development, seismic testing, dumping of agriculture wastewater, and other threats to the marine habitat.
Regarding the Salinian tribe, the sanctuary is a collaborative, grassroots effort led by the Northern Chumash Tribal Council, and it provides an exceptional opportunity to advance the first Tribal-nominated national marine sanctuary designation in the U.S., setting a precedent for elevating Indigenous perspectives and cultural values in ocean conservation.
The sanctuary will not be involved with national parks, as it is a separate designation.
The cost of establishing the sanctuary is not mentioned in the search results. However, the sanctuary would protect ocean biodiversity, including salmonids, and would advance environmental justice through collaborative management. The sanctuary would also support ocean-dependent economies.
Biodiversity would be protected through comprehensive ecosystem management, which would ensure the health of the marine habitat. If the sanctuary fails, it is not clear what would happen, but it is likely that the marine ecosystem and cultural heritage resources would continue to be threatened by human activities such as oil development and dumping of agricultural wastewater.
Overall, the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary is a proposed marine sanctuary that would protect the region's important marine ecosystems and maritime heritage resources, support ocean-dependent economies, and preserve thousands of years of Chumash cultural heritage by protecting sacred sites.
From, Rom Pico.

I offer this comment based upon insights gained from the following experiences: 
(a)	My extensive work from 2003-2010 as an independent facilitator of the Marine Interests Group of San Luis Obispo County (MIG).  The MIG began at the request of then Congress member Lois Capps and San Luis Obispo County Supervisor Shirley Bianchi to engage a multi-stakeholder group of scientists, fishermen, businesspeople, environmentalists, and local government officials to evaluate the desirability of creating a National Marine Sanctuary for the area and other measures to enhance and sustain the marine resources off of the Central Coast. Although I served without advocating any position, I did have the opportunity to listen to much scientific information and public discussion.
(b)	Experience as a facilitator of the stakeholder discussions for the State of California’s formation of MPAs along the Central Coast.
(c)	Facilitator in the creation of the California Collaborative Fisheries Research Program, which remains active today, to engage scientists and fishermen in gathering valuable information to enhance the understanding of fish stocks on the Central Coast. 
(d)	Founding member of the Ecosystem Advisory Subpanel of the Pacific Fisheries Management Council 2010-2021.
(e)	Insights from serving as an independent facilitator on behalf of the City of Morro Bay for an early community discussion about offshore wind opportunities.
(f)	Continued information gained from attendance at public discussions of the proposed sanctuary, offshore wind, and Diablo re-use opportunities. 

I underscore, however, that the following recommendations are entirely my own and do not represent the perspectives of any other persons or organizations identified above.

Recommendations for the Sanctuary

1.	Use the Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension.
a.	There are many scientific and management rationales that support continuity of marine ecosystems for optimal performance.
b.	Continuous sanctuary boundaries will enhance public understanding and ease in communication of sanctuary activities.
c.	Inclusion of Morro Bay and Estero Bay will provide important opportunities for interpretation and public participation in the sanctuary.
d.	While concerns about interfering with offshore wind or Diablo re-use are important, those can be addressed in other ways (see below). If developments in those projects don’t proceed, it’s important that the full sanctuary boundaries remain intact.

2.	Include in the designation a carve-out for offshore wind permits.
a.	Offshore wind offers many potential benefits for local communities, state, and national interests.
b.	The combination of BOEM and State regulatory authorities create extensive requirements for evaluation of potential impacts and opportunities for public comment to determine whether offshore wind is in the public interest.
c.	Adding uncharted sanctuary processes and approvals for offshore wind would create concerns for duplication of efforts. With the rise in interest rates and increase in supply chain costs, an unknown sanctuary review process for offshore wind would add a level of project risk that would delay, add unnecessary costs to ratepayers, or potentially scuttle what might otherwise be a desirable project to meet local, state, and federal objectives.

3.	Include in the designation a carve-out for Diablo use/re-use.
a.	There has been relatively little public discussion about any ramifications of sanctuary designation upon the use and re-use of the Diablo Canyon Power Plant property. 
b.	There are extensive regulatory processes already underway with public engagement opportunities regarding current and future uses of the property. 
c.	Since the impacts of Diablo activities are largely within California State-managed water, the sanctuary designation will be well-served to allow existing state and federal processes to proceed without adding uncertainty about potentially duplicative and complex involvement of a newly formed sanctuary.

I am pleased to continue to listen, learn, and share insights with others about these important issues.

I'm Cassandra Marketos, a community composter and certified Naturalist local to the Echo Park region of Los Angeles, CA, and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I previously worked in government, serving at the White House under Barack Obama, and focused on climate and conservation—working on the project to designate Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument, and I'm very familiar with and dedicated to the idea of ""preserving our oceans"" (as you can imagine!). Not only is protecting our oceans important for marine life and the ongoing health of our oceans and planet, it's essential for preserving HUMAN health and well-being. And we all know that we are running out of time to take these critical actions and try to reverse course on decades of climate abuse. 

I ask that this sanctuary includes:  

A ban on any oil & gas drilling. ANY. And funding for outreach, education, and research programs. It is wonderful to protect our oceans, but a critical part of ensuring these initiatives last (and can expand) is public education. 

Thank you for reading!

My name is Trieste Devlin, and I support the swift designation of the CHNMS to protect ocean biodiversity and environmental justice. I support designating the largest possible contiguous boundaries, including the Initial Boundary Alternative with the Gaviota Coast Extension, as shown in the Draft Environmental Impact Statement. I support the sanctuary being named the ""Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary"", and for it to include Tribal Collective Management with equitable and inclusive representation of all Central Coast Tribes, facilitated by a qualified Tribal Liason.

I am from Moss Beach, and went to college in Santa Cruz, although I live in PA now. Growing up on the coastside, the beach and the ocean were cornerstones for community, recreation, exercise, and (for me) spirituality and a connection to nature. I watched the tidepools change as overfishing, pollution, and holes in the food web took their toll - the dyeback of the seastars, then years where the beach would stink with masses of dead seals and sea lions after algal blooms and overfishing caused them to starve, then the unbalanced surge in purple sea urchins, since we didn't have many otters left to eat them or sea stars to cover the rocks. These changes were visible even to me as a small child! They were scary, they hurt my soul, and as a kid I wondered why we weren't doing more to protect our oceans.

There is no one I would trust more to steward our California coastside than the native peoples of the land. In elementary school I learned about the coastal tribes in the past tense - as if they were gone and their connection to the land as family was over. I recognize that they are still here, and still fighting for their rights and for the continued health and safety of the ocean. I am SO grateful to native people all over the world who have protected so much land even as they continue to be disenfranchised, and specifically to the Chumash and other CA Tribes. It is important to me that there is funding for the Sanctuary to partner with local schools, so that kids can be educated about Tribal history and culture (especially those in underserved communities), marine biology, and land stewardship. 

I further ask that the Sanctuary includes:
- The protection of Rodriguez Seamount, as I understand reports have indicated it will serve an important role in protecting biodiversity in the region.
- Language drafted with the input of the CA Tribes to regulate Offshore Wind to ensure ocean safety
- A prohibition on oil and gas exploration/extraction within the Sanctuary, and policy intended to reduce overall pollution in the region

I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures. I trust the CA Tribes and I believe in my heart that generations of Californians to come will truly benefit from as much of our coast as possible being protected.

Thank you to everyone working on this project.

Sincerely,

Trieste Devlin",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

You have an incredible opportunity with the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to protect and preserve a meaningful swath of our ocean. I fully support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. To maximize the benefit of protecting ocean areas, a contiguous area makes the most sense. Therefore, I support the Initial Boundary Alternative plus sub-alternative 5b in order to provide such contiguous protection. 

The diverse, rich marine life that currently exists in this area deserves to be protected. With such protection in place, the ecosystem will have the ability to repair and restore itself in an uninterrupted way.

As someone who has been diving extensively in the Marine Protected Areas off of the Channel Islands, I know how robust and beautiful these pristine ecosystems can be if we let them. Designating the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the aforementioned boundaries will not only bring great benefit to our local area, but will also serve as a model for others around the world to emulate.

I would like to add that, in principle, I support the development of offshore wind. I believe that offshore wind transmission lines can be accommodated at a later date through a special use permit. My immediate request is that this Sanctuary be approved to protect the environment from harmful activities like oil and gas drilling, dredging, and other disruptive and polluting actions.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

My name is Grant Preheim and I have been living in the central coast community my entire life. I strongly support the preservation and restoration of our marine wildlife. This especially means protecting the water entering our ocean and keeping our ocean as minimally polluted as possible. As an Electrical Engineering Technology student at Cuesta College, I have learned the immediate life threatening hazards that energy production will pose. As we have seen time and time again with oil drilling and recourse collection careless “mistakes” happen. How will wind energy production be any different? Electrical current creates a magnetic field that is harmful to all of us in the form of radiation. The amount of human activity along our coastline to build and set up a wind energy farm alone is destructive to our proposed sanctuary. A wind energy farm under any circumstances directly cause our waters to be radioactive. After years of studying electricity in Cuesta College’s state-of-the-art power laboratory, harvesting wind energy from our central coast is not a worthwhile plan for the longevity and health of anyone. All other protections for our coast described in the sanctuary proposition are necessary for our survival as living beings. Thank you for the opportunity. I am looking forward to seeing that this time of change will be great and not abused by the decision makers.

My name is Brooke Harness and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.
I live in Visalia, California and the central coast is my beach. I want to protect the sea animals so that the people who were turned into sea animals (referencing the Chumash story of the Rainbow Bridge) are safe because I don’t want them to get hurt. I also want turtles and dolphins and orcas to be safe. We need to take out the trash in the water and keep the water clean to protect them and not throw any nets at them. We need to not do anything to hurt them. Except not sharks very much because I don’t like them. I want to have the marine sanctuary so that the little animals can all stay safe and be happy and feed them if we can. 
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes covering as much of the coast as possible by using the Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension, that it should be called Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, that it should have Tribal Collaborative Management, that there should be educational programs to teach me and my family traditional ecological knowledge to better take care of our beautiful ocean, that it should be protected by the Rodriguez Seamount to protect the many different types of animal life that live there, and that new oil and gas development should not happen here.
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures and gifts.

I have been following the unfolding of this possibility since its inception.

I am in support of NOAA's ORIGINAL Initial Boundary Alternative map. By so doing, the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary would incorporate a contiguous area, beginning at the southern point of the Monterey Bay Marine Sanctuary, in the waters offshore of Cambria.  The proposed sanctuary, in my opinion, must begin at that point--from Cambria to Point Concepcion, incorporating 7,600 square miles. To choose any other map, not only greatly lessens the area for the sanctuary, but it also excludes a large area that Central Coastal Indigenous peoples lived in.  In honoring the Chumash, Salinan and all Indigenous peoples who deserve recognition in proclaiming this sanctuary, ALL areas of their habitation along the Central Coast must be included--to do otherwise, would dishonor the very people the proposed Sanctuary plans to recognize and honor. 
  
From NOAA's website, describing a marine sanctuary: ""National marine sanctuaries are special areas that protect important marine ecosystems around the nation. Some sanctuaries are breeding and feeding grounds for endangered whales, others contain thriving coral reefs or kelp forests, and many are home to historic shipwrecks and other archaeological treasures.""  Protecting a National Marine Sanctuary should not exclude 2,000 square miles from the proposed sanctuary, where no protections would be given -- in fact, just the opposite, to include the area from Cambria to Montana de Oro.  NOAA's description explains the reason for the exclusion of 2,000 square miles, thusly:  ""Second, the preferred boundary excludes a wide area that could serve as a corridor for the industrial development associated with offshore wind energy production (specifically subsea electrical transmission cables and substations from the Morro Bay Wind Energy Area to shore), given that certain concentrations of this infrastructure may not be compatible with a national marine sanctuary depending on the number of cables and disturbance that could occur.""  This would hardly seem to fit with the protections NOAA cites in the quote I referred to above, or in its Initial Boundary Alternative (Map #1), which would provide more protections.

I urge NOAA to reconsider the first map it initially selected: The Initial Boundary Alternative Map, and NOT the Agency Preferred Map.  Please maintain the integrity of your own words, the integrity of the ocean and the safety of the creatures who dwell within and who soar above.  May this Marine Sanctuary be given ALL the protections it deserves, honoring the Indigenous peoples who inhabited the lands along California's Central Coast and the ocean's precious ecosystem and marine habitat.

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the historic significance of a Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, not only for the Central Coast of California, but for the entire nation.

My family moved to Morro Bay in the '70's, attracted by it's natural beauty and majestic coastline.  I am in full support of establishing the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with it's Initial Boundary Alternative.  It has been well documented what harm off-shore wind farms can do to sea life and migrating whales.  Also, what is not mentioned, along with the implementation of a wind farm is the actual construction involved.  Which means that the harbor of Morro Bay, which is the home to sea otters, seals, and other marine wildlife, would be turned into an industrial port.  A place where locals, and visitors like to kayak and sail would be turned into an port where large ships and barges bring materials out for construction.  This would entail large scale dredging to accommodate larger ships, the loss of Coleman Beach to where a proposed large commercial dock would be constructed, and the absolute beauty of our harbor would be ravaged. Marine life would loose their natural habitats to this construction as well.
I firmly believe that the only sustainable, just, and equitable way forward for Morro Bay - and the surrounding Central Coast - is to establish the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative. It is time that we learn from past mistakes, listen to community leaders with generational knowledge, and fully commit to protecting the health of our marine ecosystems. There is inevitable loss and transformation that will unfold in Morro Bay as a result of climate change - we cannot undo the past, but we can fight for the future. I urge the NOAA to do everything in its power to protect heritage and biodiversity for generations to come.""",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

The Leaseholders acknowledge the effort, time, and thoughtfulness of NOAA ONMS in development of the proposed CHNMS Draft Environmental Impact Statement, Draft Management Plan, and Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, which reflect the agency’s effort to balance multiple uses, stakeholder requests for conservation, and other considerations in the Central Coast of California.  

These comments represent our collective commitments to responsible offshore wind development, environmental stewardship, and as neighbors of the future CHNMS committed to fighting climate change, which is one of the most significant threats to the marine resources the CHNMS seeks to protect.

Although I deeply respect the initiative behind CHNMS to preserve the ocean environment, I believe NOAA’s draft rules are shortsighted with respect to a potentially critical need to support water supply onshore.  As written in the current draft, all of the current State and Federal permitting safeguards would continue to be in place, as well as new regulations imposed by the Sanctuary as an overlaying jurisdiction; this extensive permitting hurdle will substantially reduce the odds the new desalination projects could be brought to bear to support basic water needs during extended drought.  

Meanwhile new offshore desalination technologies such as SeaWell’s continue to reduce impacts and improve energy efficiency, and promise to be among the least environmentally impactful means of obtaining freshwater of any system currently utilized, including the State Water Project.  Without compromising any existing permitting requirements, having desalination recognized as a potential future need would go a long way to enabling a path for permitting, which would still be subject to CEQA and NEPA, as well as the Coastal Commission’s Coastal Development Permit.

I URGE YOU TO PLEASE INCLUDE DESALINATION AS A RECOGNIZED, POTENTIAL ACTIVITY WITHIN THE CHNMS.

I am submitting comments from Californians for Western Wilderness (CalUWild), a citizens organization with nearly 900 members and supporters. We are dedicated to encouraging and facilitating participation in legislative and administrative actions affecting wilderness and other public lands in the West. Our members use and enjoy the public lands and coastal waters all over the West.

CalUWild appreciates this opportunity to comment on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement and Draft Management Plan for the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, proposed by the Biden Administration and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and nominated by the Northern Chumash Tribal Council.

First, and most importantly, we are in favor of this establishment wholeheartedly. Three significant reasons stand behind our support: 1) Protection of the ocean itself and the myriad forms of life that live in it and that it nourishes; 2) Protection of the coastline that forms the boundary, particularly from local oil spills; and 3) The opportunity it provides for the Chumash and Salinan Tribes to reclaim some of their traditional heritage through collaborative management and stewardship with NOAA.

CalUWild fully supports the name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary.” This name honors the Indigenous Tribes who have called the area home for many, many years and who nominated the Sanctuary.

To further that recognition, we support formalized structures of Tribal collaborative management with NOAA, allowing as many interested Tribes as practical to be full partners in the planning and stewardship of the Sanctuary’s resources. The management should include full use of traditional ecological knowledge and practices.

CalUWild supports the “Initial Boundary Alternative” with the addition of the Gaviota Coast Extension from Sub-Alternative 5-b. These boundaries would protect the largest area and the most biodiversity. The largest area also makes the largest contribution to the Administration’s goal of protecting 30% of America’s waters by 2030.

As part of this protection, we support a ban on all new oil & gas development, including exploration, with the Sanctuary’s boundaries. The risk of environmental damage from such activities is simply too high. (Additionally, we have a goal of reducing our consumption of petroleum products, so in theory we won’t need to be conducting so much exploration anyway.)

We support the inclusion of the Rodriguez Seamount. Its wonderful biodiversity requires its protection.

Finally, CalUWild supports NOAA’s proposed efforts to develop robust research educational programs, stressing both the best of “Western” science and traditional knowledge and history, with results made easily accessible to all who might be interested.

Thank you for the opportunity to comment. Please inform us of your decision in this matter and please also inform us of further opportunities to be involved in your public decision-making processes.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary: 

I support the Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension.
While I don't have an indigenous background I support an equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management.

I also think the protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity!
To protect the ecosystem and human health, there should be a prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries.
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I passionately believe the Administration should designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures. As a plant scientist and diver I am acutely aware of the importance of eelgrass to ecosystem health, and the benefits it provides. It needs to be protected.

My name is Lexy Alari Harness and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.
I live in Visalia, California and the central coast is one of my favorite places. I’ve been going there with my family since I was a child and now I bring my daughters there whenever I can. It’s become a special and sacred place for me, even more so after finding out through DNA testing that my ancestors were indigenous to the California coast. The coast is in my blood. Every person deserves a clean ocean and to look out across the sea to the horizon without seeing oil rigs and pollution. I want this place and every life form lucky enough to be there to be protected; for myself, for my children, for my children’s children, and many more generations of Californians. 
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes covering as much of the coast as possible by using the Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension, that it should be called Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, that it should have Tribal Collaborative Management, that there should be educational programs to teach me and my family traditional ecological knowledge to better take care of our beautiful ocean, that it should be protected by the Rodriguez Seamount to protect the many different types of animal life that live there, and that new oil and gas development should not happen here.
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures and gifts.
 
Sincerely,

I am writing to convey to you the support of the designation of the proposed Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, the first tribal-lead designation effort in the history of the national marine sanctuary system. We know well the area, love it and need to protect it for future generations. 

Named after the local native American tribes, the new sanctuary would reflect the contribution of the coastal Chumash tribes and the First Nation to the health of the ocean. Indeed, their rich maritime heritage underscores the deep significance of the ocean to humanity. The ocean is a living part of their mythology, and they continue honoring their ancestors through a “pilgrimage” to the Island of Santa Cruz in their traditional redwood canoe (Tomol). The AC recognizes the value of diversity in stakeholders and values diverse stakeholder representation supporting this designation, in particular with regard to maritime and Native American heritage. In light of dramatic climactic and cultural shifts occurring now, there is an urgent need for tribal entities and federal agencies to take a cooperative stewardship role.
The CHNMS is designed to include the continental shelf as well as the escarpment rich with deep underwater canyons. It is influenced by the California Current and subjected to the yearly upwelling that yields some of the most productive waters on Earth. It provides a link between its three sister sanctuaries to the north (Monterey Bay, Greater Farallones, and Cordell Bank national marine sanctuaries) and the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary to the south, from Point Arena to Santa Barbara. Furthermore, it sets aside a stretch of ocean that would help science better assess the biological productivity of this system and enhance its understanding of ocean dynamics in the context of climate change.
By virtue of its designation as a sanctuary, CHNMS would be protected from oil and gas exploration as well as seafloor ocean mining, restrictions which would help protect local fisheries and the clean coast economy. Both of these industrial activities now pose an increased threat to the region. CHNMS would also be able to implement regulations against large ship discharges which has been identified as an environmental problem.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes: 

Biggest Possible Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension
Sanctuary Name: The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”
Tribal Collaborative Management: An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management.
Outreach & Education: Outreach, education and research programs that elevate both indigenous Knowledge and indigenous science and access for local underserved communities
Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity
Ban Oil & Gas: A prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries!!!!

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures. This is an opportunity to make for the nation to be a leader in conservation projects that only protect our plant but also through partnerships with native peoples.

I am also asking that you designate the sanctuary using the initial boundaries proposed (Initial Boundary Alternative), plus the Gaviota Extension (sub-alternative 5b).  Doing this would provide contiguous protection between the Monterey Bay and Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuaries.

The proposed Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary contains a rich, diverse marine environment, cultural resources such as submerged historic Chumash villages, and shipwrecks, all of which are deserving of protection.

Looking towards the future, offshore wind transmission cables could be accommodated through a special use permit at a later date.  In the meantime, we must permanently protect the area from harmful activities like oil and gas development, seabed mining and dredging (a huge possibility for Lithium Ion battery production), and harmful polluting discharges to our waters.

Thank you for protecting our Central Coast with this National Marine Sanctuary.

My name is Dennis Lees, Littoral Ecological & Environmental Services, and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.
I live in Encinitas, CA, and to me, the ocean has been, for all my adult life, a major focus of my professional and recreational activities.
I recently read the CalMatters report on the proposed wind farms off California and became particularly concerned about potential impacts of the proposed farm off Lompoc on infaunal resources in that area. I am an infaunal ecologist with a strong interest and expertise in the composition and secondary production of these sedimentary ecosystems. First, I know the infauna on that continental shelf off Lompoc/Vandenberg Space Force Base has been little studied, if at all, since the sparse collections (seven stations, in all) by Velero IV, Allan Hancock Foundation, U. S. C., in 1957. That lack of knowledge extends to most of the nearshore habitats within the boundaries of the entire proposed sanctuary.

Second, I suspect the assemblages on the shelf off Lompoc and Vandenberg are very productive, especially because of their location just north of Point Conception. It is highly likely they provide considerable nutrition to a variety of valuable commercial fisheries species, to sea otters, and possibly to migrating gray whales. 

Third, I know that methods currently used to sample those types of assemblage greatly underestimate the biomass and secondary production of those assemblages. Thus, they greatly undervalue them; this is the topic of my recently published paper and of a manuscript currently in a late stage of preparation. One reason these ecosystems are so poorly known is that current methods do not sample most of the ""trees"", i.e., the non-migratory megainfauna, which bury too deeply in the sediments (often more than a meter) to be sampled by conventional methodologies, which generally do not sample deeper than 10 cm into the sediment. They also are too uncommon, relatively, to be given consideration by the current cohort of numbers-fixated infaunal investigators, who do not consider biomass. The importance of the “trees” is based primarily on their much greater biomass and the contributions through predation to other trophic levels. Another reason they are so poorly known is there has been very little funding to study these rich productive habits, even in estuaries.

Fourth, a manuscript I am currently preparing, a follow-on to the earlier “weeds and trees” paper, demonstrates, with solid hard data, that current approaches (grab or box-core sampling) underestimate biomass by a factor of about 300, i.e., the biomass of the ""trees"" can be about 300 times that of the ""weeds"", or macrofauna, which is generally sampled by current inadequate sampling techniques. Based on analyses in my current manuscript, the ""trees"" likely conservatively contribute 30 times more energy to other trophic levels than the ""weeds"", excluding contributions of reproductive and excretory products.

Bottom lines: 1) The proposed areas for wind farms off Lompoc/Vandenberg and nearshore areas of the proposed sanctuary need to be carefully sampled to determine the nature of the overall infaunal ecosystems and how much energy these likely very rich assemblages contribute to associated trophic levels and fisheries.  The value of these assemblages must be determined. 2) This sampling cannot be accomplished by standard contemporary methods as these cannot sample the non-migratory megafauna adequately. These form the major basis for the benthic-related food webs for many important, some endangered, species that could be affected by installation and operation of the Lompoc/Vandenberg proposed wind farms and other activities that may take place in the sanctuary. 
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes: 
•	Biggest Possible Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension
•	Sanctuary Name: The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”

My name is Dr. Michelle Merrill. I'm the founder of an ecospiritual and ecoactivist organization called Novasutras. I live in Santa Clara, California. I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

To me, the ocean is sacred. In Novasutras, we believe that all life is connected and must be treated with reverence. Connecting with the ocean is essential for our spiritual well-being, and the coasts are vital spaces for reconnecting with community, human and more-than-human. 

I also have the deepest respect for the original people who cared for this coast, its lands and waters. As aware beings, we all have an obligation to care for our amazing, beautiful ocean planet.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes: 
The widest possible boundary, with the Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension, including the Rodriguez Seamount, and a ban on fossil fuel projects. Prohibition of new oil and gas development within sanctuary boundaries will best honor our responsibility to care for the lands and waters, to stabilize the climate, and to protect biodiversity, so that all ocean and coastal beings have a better chance to thrive.
The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary” and Tribal Collaborative Management. An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management will best honor those original peoples who have cared for this coastal area and ocean for millennia. Outreach, education and research programs that elevate Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) are also required for respectful relationship.
Access for local underserved communities is another vital component of the sanctuary. Those who most need nature, yet are often least able to access it, should be a major focus of outreach and education.

I wholeheartedly support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

In addition to the above comments of support, on a more personal level, I support the designation of the Chumash National Marine Sanctuary because just in the short 35 years of my life, I have seen a dramatic decline in the amount of open space and pristine environments, as well as a marked decline in the number of animals I see in the wild. I am so appalled at how quickly we are destroying our planet. Nature does tend to be resilient but if we keep going as we are, we will hit a threshold that will lead to our demise and to irreversible damage to the planet as we know it. Species come and go, but through more natural causes. We are wreaking havoc with so little regard for the consequences. Please, take this one step in the right direction, towards environmental stewardship and the protection of our planet. This sanctuary will mean more legal protection, less damaging activities to ecosystems, and preservation of cultural resources.

I am writing to support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. The designation of the CHNMS should include the largest possible contiguous boundaries, the Initial Boundary Alternative with the Gaviota Coast Extension (Sub-Alt 5b), because it would provide the most protection to this important area. We do not support NOAA’s Alternatives 2, 3, and 4 because they would not protect a critical area of coastline that contains important Chumash cultural sites, marine habitat, and local communities. First, please support the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary name. It is meant to recognize people who have lived on this coast for over 10,000 years; protect the heritage of the Chumash, an ocean-going band among the First People of the Pacific Coast; and provide a timely and appropriate reminder of the cultural origins. We support equitable inclusion of all Central Coast Tribes, both federally and non-federally recognized Tribes, in collaborative management. All sanctuary stakeholders will benefit from Indigenous input.  It is vital that Sanctuary education and community outreach partner with area schools to share information about sanctuary species and habitats and Chumash history and culture. Outreach should be multilingual, culturally relevant, and should focus on underserved communities. In addition, regulations to protect Rodriguez Seamount should move forward. The seamount provides critical habitat for an extremely diverse and abundant array of marine life and deserves to be granted strong and permanent protection. The seamount has special national significance that warrants special protections through sanctuary designation. Once damaged, fragile seamount ecosystems may not recover in our lifetime. The proposed CHNMS will protect our beloved ocean now that Offshore Wind (OSW) farms are being established off the Central California Coast. Sanctuary designation is needed before OSW and other environmental impacts affect the habitat, wildlife, and water quality. California’s first offshore wind projects must reflect leasing, siting, and permitting decisions that are guided by planning and comprehensive scientific research on the potential impacts to sensitive marine areas and species and coastal resources, including cumulative impacts. I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

My name is Michele Whiteaker. I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I grew up in Santa Barbara and Ventura, California. My entire childhood was spent on boats in the Pacific Ocean off Santa Barbara and Ventura. My family cruised on our sailboat and later powerboat to the anchorages of Santa Cruz Island. I learned about the Chumash: at Vieja Valley Elementary School, reading Island of the Blue Dolphins in 3rd grade (and imagining myself as the main character when we were out at the islands), on visits to the Santa Barbara Natural History Museum, and at 6th grade environmental education camp at Lake Cachuma. My schooling did a great job of weaving what's now known and promoted as TEK (traditional environmental knowledge) to the point where I felt -- and still feel -- a true connection to the environment around me and appreciated the stewardship of the Chumash people.

I'm a 1990 graduate of Ventura High School. My parents still live in Ventura County. I am just a few hours away in Laguna Hills, CA. When I go to the coast, I am sad that the tidepools of my youth are not in existence anymore. In my 50 year lifetime, I've noticed the sea creatures dwindle as the population and demands on the fragile ocean ecosystem increase. I think the MPAs and designations such as this are the only way to preserve what we have and it's honestly my only hope that we can turn things around - by turning towards the original stewardship which protected it and made it thrive.

I want my kids and future grandkids to be able to be drawn to the ocean like I have been. To find peace here and connection that I can't find anywhere else. I work hard in my community of Orange County promoting play and empowering OC families to prioritize outside time. If I still lived in Santa Barbara or Ventura, the waters off the coast would be a big part of that.

The ocean is a sanctuary to so many living things. I've chronicled a central coast summer which I call the ""Summer of Humpbacks"" where we watched the whales feeding from the pier at San Simeon and the bluffs of Cambria. I want this to not be a fleeting thing. I want more generations to experience these natural wonders. 

I emphatically support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes:

Biggest Possible Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension.
Sanctuary Name: The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”.
Tribal Collaborative Management: An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management.
Outreach & Education: Outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities (like the kind I got throughout my childhood, but for ALL).
Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity.
Ban Oil & Gas: A prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries. This is KEY!

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

Thank you for your time and I hope you consider this letter as a very personal plea,

I have worked as a commercial fishermen for over several decades. I am a chairman on the Port San Luis Commercial Fisherman's Association and the Whale Working Group. I am writing to express my complete opposition to the proposed sanctuary. The CHNMS poses a significant threat to the future of fishermen culture and it will disrupt the current delicate balance between man and the ocean in the area identified for CHNMS creations.  Despite claims, existing marine protected sanctuaries show no scientifically proven benefits to the ocean. The scope of the management plan declares policies of protection already in place by the current conservation regulation and enforced by CDFW/ PFMC. This is a waste of government resources. Further the general public and cultural organizations such as the PSLCFA  repeatedly opposed the formation of sanctuaries within this area multiple times but NOAA keeps changing the sanctuary name and reproposong it. Lastly, the neo-indigenous Chumash are being used as a politic pawn, a poster child of for a political agenda. This concludes my reasoning for rejecting the CHNMS. Thank you for your time and consideration!

This region represents our ancestral homeland, which includes the area under consideration for the new national marine sanctuary. While I acknowledge the historical presence of the Chumash in this land, it's crucial to recognize that The Salinan name should not be omitted in this context.

Various groups without clear tribal affiliations have attempted to establish cultural boundaries based on landmarks such as Morro Rock, Diablo Canyon, and Point Conception. It's worth noting that the United States only began surveying and defining territorial rights during European exploration in the 1700s, and this concept was not applied to California until it became a state in 1850. The ongoing division of indigenous cultures through territorial lines is inaccurate and misleading.

1. I wholeheartedly endorse the creation of a new national sanctuary along the Central Coast of California and fully support the approval of the Initial Boundary Alternative as the ultimate boundary for this sanctuary.

2. I vehemently oppose any reduction in the protected area from the originally proposed sanctuary boundary, as outlined in the Initial Boundary Alternative.

3. The sanctuary's name should follow established practice, using geographical features as a basis, just as previously established sanctuaries have been named.

4. I suggest that NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) establish a collaborative relationship with the California Native American Heritage Commission to develop a process ensuring that tribal representatives participating in the sanctuary management process have a validated ancestral and cultural affiliation with the Central Coast.

5. I recommend that NOAA extend the same advisory capacity and input opportunities to non-federally recognized tribes as they do to federally recognized tribes. Additionally, culturally affiliated tribes should be appropriately represented on the advisory council.

6. I propose that the primary designated consultation entities for any matters related to this sanctuary be the Salinan and Chumash people.

I sincerely appreciate your attention to our concerns and issues.

The concern over the disturbance due to undersea cables from offshore wind facilities can be moderated and  better controlled through the use of the permitting process under the NMS designation, as is already done elsewhere (and the exemptions granted to DoD make these cables a minor distubance). This also  creates protections for the area in general, which would not happen if excluded.

The name dispute is unfortunate. I'd suggest a combined name, and if that is not acceptable then something culturally significant but with neither tribal name included.

Towards this objective, we have made countless sacrifices, sometimes at the expense of nature. We have abandoned a sustainable balance with the one from which we came, which we owe our very existence to. Now we seek to correct wrongs and make amends by again tarnishing and interfering with the fragile tapestry of nature. The NOAA revised area of the Chumash heritage National Marine Sanctuary, has done just this. It has excluded, area around and in Morro bay which it has leased to Trident Winds and TotalEnergies Renewables USA. They seek to alter the landscape dramatically, transforming miles of wild ocean into forests of metal trunks and canopies of aluminum blades. Supporters of this Castle Wind project, argue that it provides high-paying job opportunities and satisfies the states requirements toward Net Zero carbon. While all of this is true, it establishes the precedent for further exploitation and commercialization of the open oceans, which could have disastrous consequences similar to the establishment of offshore oil rigs. Perhaps this is an unstoppable force, yet arguing against every decision could potentially save one mile from pollution and allows the sea otters, kelp, and fishes to flourish is a victory. As a cautionary note, the Brazilian government has permitted portions of the mighty Amazon rainforest to be destroyed for the soy meal which feeds their large beef industry. I view this dispute as a microcosm of that, the effect of which could determine the landscape and ecosystem for hundreds if not thousands of years. Something which could be amplified in further contracts and development, under the raised banner of a better future. Again we arrive at the question I posed at the beginning, do we open the floodgates and allow our precious reservoir to be drained and continue our lives as usual or do we release only small amounts of water and improve our water catchment systems. My preference is the latter. Alas, if we chose the former, I seek to build a bulwark of the preservation of the marine ecosystem. To be a breakwater for the imminent flood of humanity’s wealth and influence flowing into the deep sea which will be surely brought by this ruling.

Thank you for considering this perspective.

I wish to express support for either the Initial Boundary Alternative or Alternative 1 –“Bank to Coast” for the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary.  I do not favor an alternative the excludes Morro Bay from the sanctuary.

As a lifelong Californian, and a one-time resident of San Luis Obispo County, the fact that the Pacific Ocean has remained free from the desecration of wind farms and offshore drilling, thus far, fills me with gratitude.

For future generations we should ensure that the Central Coast of California remains henceforward and forever free of such desecration.  Declaring the area of Morro Bay a national marine sanctuary would go far to ensure that protection.

I also see advantages to Alternatives 5a – Morro Bay Estuary protection, and 5b – Gaviota Coastal Extension, and I support those additional protections.

Please select one of the alternatives that protects Morro Bay as part of the marine sanctuary.  Thank you for your good work.

Dear Paul Michel,
My name is Kathleen Sharum and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.
I live in Santa Maria, California and to me, the ocean is what sustains the planet. I am so fortunate to be able to live near the beautiful, rich and diverse Central Coast of California. It is the perfect place to see firsthand how much wildlife the ocean supports and how important it is to the local economy and the economy of the State. It is so important to me that we protect the rich diversity this part of the Ocean supports. I am a birder and a retired wildlife biologist and nothing makes me feel more connected to life than to witness the power and beauty of the Ocean and all of the life that it supports.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes:
* Biggest Possible Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension
* Sanctuary Name: The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”
* Tribal Collaborative Management: An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management.

Nominated by the Northern Chumash Tribal Council in 2015, the proposed sanctuary stretches along 134 miles of coastline from Montaña de Oro State Park in San Luis Obispo County to Naples, along the Gaviota Coast in Santa Barbara County and encompasses nearly 6,000 square miles of water. The federal government is proposing this area for permanent protection as a sanctuary to preserve its rich marine ecosystem - a biological hotspot for sea birds, marine mammals including migratory whales, sea turtles, and other marine life - important offshore features like the Rodriguez Seamount and Santa Lucia Bank, and cultural resources and connections of Indigenous communities to the area.

Please designate the sanctuary using the initial boundaries proposed (Initial Boundary Alternative), plus the Gaviota Extension (sub-alternative 5b) in order to provide contiguous protection between Monterey Bay and Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuaries. This area contains a rich, diverse marine environment, cultural resources such as submerged historic Chumash villages, and shipwrecks, all of which are deserving of protection.

Potential offshore wind transmission cable corridors can be accommodated through a special use permit at a later date, but in the meantime, permanently protecting the area from harmful activities like oil and gas development, seabed mining and dredging, and harmful polluting discharges to our waters.
    
Thank you for protecting our Central Coast with this National Marine Sanctuary.

Dear Paul Michel,
We are residents of Morro Bay. We are dismayed that the waters between Cambria and Morro Bay are excluded from the proposed marine sanctuary.  We support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary that includes the biggest possible boundary – which includes the Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension.

With California’s recent commitment to the 30:30 conservation project, the inclusion of the whole area will help meet the 30% marine protection, currently at 16% in California. 

Our understanding is that for private interest and gain, you are excluding 2000 square miles?

We urge you to select the Initial Boundary Alternative plus both extensions.

Regards,
Linda Richards and Tom Gillett

I am writing as a concerned citizen of Santa Barbara County in regard to the apparent exclusion of Morro Bay and Morro Rock from the proposed boundaries of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I am very much in favor of the cultural, educational, and environmental benefits to be derived from co-managing this sanctuary with Chumash nations, so the exclusion of that sacred area undermines the full potential of the sanctuary. Since there is no proposed prohibition on fishing rights within the sanctuary, I cannot see any reasonable objection to linking up the proposed sanctuary with the pre-existing Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. Certainly it may complicate the permitting process for the cabling necessary to enable offshore wind development, but it by no means prohibits it. I fully believe that enhanced protections for our natural and cultural treasures is fully worth the added difficulty to the permitting process. What's more, I agree on principal that Chumash and other concerned Indigenous peoples should have the right to weigh in on developments in their homelands. Bringing in these stakeholders would be a positive development for democracy and promoting reconciliation with Indigenous Californian nations, who are an indispensable part of our state's social fabric. In sum, I entreat you to include the areas of Morro Bay and Morro Rock in the proposed sanctuary; it is a winning proposition for all parties.

We have only one California marine environment and we need to protect as much of it as possible.  Regardless of the benefits of offshore wind farms, the Pacific Ocean offshore from our Golden State is not the place for them.

Therefore, regarding the creation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, I support either the Initial Boundary Alternative or Alternative 1 – “Bank to Coast”.  Morro Bay must be included within the boundaries of the Sanctuary.

My name is Leo Corley and I am reaching out to you to express my support of the true and complete designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover approx. 7600 sq. miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity, including people, and habitats.  
      I live in Paso Robles, Ca and I grew up here.  My family is a part of the original Californianos and we have always had a presence here along this sacred stretch of coast, from Santa Barbara and continuing up the Hwy coast towards Monterey.  My dad is the founder of the Black Surfing Association, learned to surf in Cayucos with Morro Bay being his home break.  The ocean means everything to our family and so does our relationship with other indigenous people.  These are the things our lives are built around.  
	I grew up around the ocean and the ocean is a sanctuary to our family and for many.  We have enjoyed and treasured our wild coastline and I wish to see that protected.  The issue I see with many modern environmental movements is the exclusion of the indigenous people as a part of the native flora and fauna and part of what needs to be protected and acknowledged when considering the environment.  I urge you to respect and honor the leadership and vision of the indigenous people of this land and coastline and to prioritize this over prospects for development.  Morro Bay, Lisamu’, is the heart of the people and this designation proposal and must be included in the sanctuary designation as well as Cayucos and Cambria. Furthermore, it seems like the environmental impacts of creating a giant wind farm off the coast of Morro Bay are unknown which also feels very negligent and irresponsible as well as disrespect to the local indigenous tribes and people who believed the sanctuary designation would have also protected these waters, coast and ecosystems.  
I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary.  I insist that it includes the following:  The Initial Boundary Alternative with the Gaviota Coast Extension, the name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”, there must be Tribal Collaborative Management using an equitable approach and respect and reverence to the Indigenous people of this land and coast, Education, outreach and access centering Traditional Ecological Knowledge and access for local marginalized communities, the protection of the Rodriguez Seamount and a permanent ban on new oil and gas development. 
	Please honor the Chumash People and the work they have put into creating the marine sanctuary designation and those who see and support their vision of the benefit of all of us including the non-human life the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary would protect.  This coast needs to be protected from development.  I urge the Administration to designate the CHNMS for the safety and future of all who originated here, those here and those who are yet to come.
Sincerely, Leo Corley

My name is Jennifer Bushman and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats. I am a board member for the Marine Mammal Center and the founder of Fed by Blue. An organization that believes in the importance of foods from water that are responsibly caught or raised. At the core, we believe that an MPA, overseen by the Chumash Tribe is not only important to our state but as an urgently needed example of the role that Indigenous communities can play in ocean conservation. Left alone, with the oversight of the tribe, this designation will the result in abundance that will eventually spill over into unprotected zones, stocking new areas with fish that can be harvested for human consumption. There are many opportunity zones already designated along our California coastline. The trust, the education opportunities and the impact that this will designation create is tremendous. 

I have worked closely with Michael Rubino is the Senior Advisor for Seafood Strategy  and Dr. Paul Doremus, Former Deputy Assistant Administrator of Operations for NOAA.  We have developed many discussions that align the conservation community, the fish and seafood community and the role that our waters play in contribution to our food system. There is no doubt that the trust and stewardship that this group will bring is vitally needed. There are other distinct regions where wind energy can be developed. Places where we can align ocean protection with ocean production. But this is not the place nor the time.  

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary.

I am a lifelong Californian having lived in Southern California for over 20 years, then on the coast of southern and central California for close to 50 years.  My family lived in Santa Barbara for 35 years and we are currently residents of Cambria, California. It is our most cherished place on the planet, the place that we call home.  Our neighbors are magnificently more than human, and beyond wondrous and unexpected! Otters, elephant seals, condors, whales, kelp beds…marine and birdlife, migrators in air and water and land, constant residents of forest or meadow or tidelands, beaches, deep sea. All are cherished!

My engagement with the coast is deep and eternal.  My background is as a choreographer, dance ethnologist (ethnochoreologist), and artist/educator.  I am an advocate and activist for wildlife, and support with all of my being the Rights of Nature. (I am a member of GARN, the Global Alliance for the Rights of Nature which recognizes the intrinsic rights of Nature.)  In the arts I am a site specific choreographer and an environmental choreographer.  This means that my career has centered on exploring the natural coastline and environs, observing and connecting in a spiritual and respectful way with the sentient beings that we share this paradise with, performing in and for Nature while developing creative, sensitized multi-generational and cross cultural community.  In passionately adopting this life’s work, I continue to spend a great deal of time in Nature, as an observer, experiencer, and storyteller.  It is my life’s blood.  Not only do I bring professional dancers into Nature, but I introduce children, their families, and those new to artistic expression or natural environment into an immersion with the Extraordinary that is all around them. 
As a Dance Ethnologist I value deepfelt respect for place memory, and sacred space, and life-affirming, compassion- driven rituals and ceremonies. Our Earth desperately needs to regenerate this reverence, this healing! This world view continually reconnects and transforms a community’s connection to the rest of the natural world…all that is seen and unseen.  I support the protection of indigenous sacred space, input, and education to underserved/under-represented communities.  From our earliest childhood we should all be immersed in a reverence for the natural environment, so that we will protect it until the end of time.

The community of Cambria, in San Luis Obispo County,  is considered to be a “Blue Zone” where people live healthy lives due to outdoor engagement, the healing quality of Nature and other restorative practices.  This area is also a place that is working towards a Green way of life.  When you meet someone out for a walk, they look at the ocean or sunset and say that this is why they live here (without most of the conveniences of a city.). Residents feel that it is unfortunate if they miss the sunset on the ocean at the end of the day.  We socialize during walks on the bluffs by the ocean, and connect with our neighbors there.
Cambria is also trying to be certified as a Dark Skies community, which has significant impacts on wildlife and all of the natural processes that requires the dark night!  Imagine seeing and celebrating the starry night and constellations.  Imagine Quiet!  I hope that we attain that rare certification.

The Windfarm off the coast and the shrinking of the parameters of the Chumash Marine Sanctuary are at odds with what is most precious and extraordinary about this place.  The infrastructure required of these windfarms will industrialize this coast.  The wind farm itself will have unbearable consequences for sensitive wildlife who are much more sensitive than humans to their surroundings and impacts.  The construction periods, the anchoring to the seafloor , the pipes from sea to land, the cacophony of workers, the effect of piers and human activity, the maintenance…all with good intentions for clean energy will decimate paradise.  If I can hear Space X launches in Vandenberg rattling and shaking my Cambria home, how is the sensitive Marine Life not affected? What about earthquakes off the coast, Tsunami activity?
Marine mammals, marine life, seabirds come to this area for its cooler waters in the midst of climate crisis,  They need sanctuary!!!  Humans also need a place to restore and heal. Visitors need places they can come to in order to see what harmony with the natural environment could look and feel like…so that their own places of residence and communities might also be restored. Let our relationship to Harmony and life-giving co-existence with the rest of Nature not be reduced to nostalgia.Let it be our living legacy to this planet.",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

My name is Grace Abbott and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I live in Goleta, California, and I grew up in Freeport, Maine. I've always had a deep connection to the ocean. Spending any time on or near the sea is healing and reinvigorating. Submerging myself in the ocean is incredibly powerful for when I'm facing personal struggles—it's an incredibly spiritual experience that reminds me that I am not separate from the ocean and all that she holds. I'm so grateful to the sea and all its beings. I grew up eating from the ocean. My favorite tradition is gathering Quohogs where my dad grew up on Waquoit Bay, Massachusetts. This is a small part of my personal history, yet Chumash communities have been tending these waters for thousands of years. Many have been torn away from their traditional lifeways and reciprocal relations with ocean entities. However, many are still practicing and reclaiming these traditions. 

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary include the largest possible contiguous boundaries, as seen in the Initial Boundary Alternative combined with the Gaviota Coast Extension (Sub-Alternative 5b). I don't support NOAA’s Alternatives 2, 3, and 4, because they reduce the size and protection of the sanctuary by some 2,000 square miles. This would eliminate connectivity
with the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, leaving out important cultural sites, including Morro Rock/Lisamu’, and removing critical protections for marine habitat and species, including the threatened Southern sea otters.

I also support the name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary” to recognize the people who've lived on this coast since time immemorial; protect the heritage of the Chumash people, an ocean-going band among the First People of the Pacific Coast; recognize people who have been denied recognition in so many other ways; and honor the late Chief Fred Collin’s nomination and vision for the Sanctuary and the 10 years of work that the Northern Chumash Tribal Council did to campaign for the Sanctuary.


I support equitable collaborative management that includes all local Tribal groups who would like to be involved, and Indigenous peoples who are not tribally-affiliated. I support the creation of a Tribal Sanctuary Advisory Council made up of all interested local Tribal groups and Indigenous peoples, as well as a NOAA Tribal Liaison.

I support the largest proposed boundary, the Initial Boundary Alternative with the Gaviota Coast Extension (Sub-Alternative 5b), to ensure a contiguous buffer of ocean protection while directing offshore Wind development to more suitable areas further offshore where wind energy is optimal
and ecological and cultural impacts can be reduced. The sanctuary will also allow for robust monitoring and research needed to understand the long-term impacts of Offshore Wind. Any offshore Wind transmission cables proposed for this area as part of future offshore wind development should require permits from the National Marine Sanctuary Program to ensure that they are planned and sited in a thoughtful, consolidated manner to reduce and mitigate impacts to the ocean. We ask for meaningful and long-lasting collaboration with conservation and marine protection.

I oppose the proposed projects off of Vandenberg based on serious environmental, cultural, and permitting-process issues. The projects are irresponsibly sited too close to the shore, in a uniquely biodiverse location, with highly significant fisheries and unacceptable impacts on critical cultural sites.

I support Sanctuary water quality programs and regulations that reduce pollution, by preventing harmful discharges and excessive runoff of sediments, oils, nutrients, pesticides, and pathogens.

I support multilingual and multicultural education and outreach for the Sanctuary that centers engagement with local underserved communities. Support partnering with Tribal and community groups, local area schools, and educators to share information about local marine science, conservation, and Chumash history and culture.

I support strong and permanent regulations to protect the Rodriguez Seamount because it provides a critical habitat for an extremely diverse and abundant array of marine life.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

As a lifelong resident of California’s central coast, I strongly support the designation of the new Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary as proposed by the Northern Chumash Tribal Council and submitted to NOAA in 2015. 

I was born and raised in Carpinteria, California and returned to live here 20 years later as local who has traveled the world and now appreciates more fully the biodiversity and fragility of the marine ecosystem, as well as the rich cultural and historical heritage of the ocean-going Chumash People. 

As a child, I grew up boogie-boarding, tide-pooling, dolphin-spotting, and swimming at Santa Barbara County beaches. As an adult, I now paddle offshore and have encountered incredible marine life, ranging from juvenile white sharks to dolphins to rays. I now understand more deeply the biological richness of our kelp forests, reef systems, and ocean currents. 

Not only does our community depend on the ocean for food, recreation, well-being, and a thriving tourism economy, but we also bear the responsibility to steward our local waters for the greater global good. Establishing the sanctuary will facilitate the health of the marine environment, scientific research, and the maritime culture of the Chumash People. 

For these reasons, I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary encompasses the most extensive possible boundary; that it be named the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to honor the local First People; that the Chumash Nation be fundamental to the sanctuary’s collaborative management; and that any new oil and gas development be banned within the sanctuary’s boundaries. 

I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our spectacular ocean heritage.

I remember many times my family got together and played sports there such as volleyball. We would also barbecue there. Quality time with family is something important to me and being at the beach is a place where we do that frequently. The ocean also helps me with clearing my mind after having a stressful week. Getting to head over there, relax in the sun and get in the water feels great. Also, the ocean is something very mysterious and can be scary. There is still so much of what we don’t know about the ocean. I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes and equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management. To make different Tribes feel included I feel is something very important. I also ask that it includes outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge and access for local underserved communities.

Thank you for agreeing to receive and review comments on the pending decisions regarding the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. This is an issue that I’ve been following for at least one year. I’ve reviewed the documents on your website that relate with this. 

I myself of an avid ocean swimmer, and beach walker,  and have lived both in Santa Barbara county, and in San Luis Obispo County, swimming at various points along the Morro Bay coast, including the Strand, and Montana De Oro . Morro Bay itself is a very unique ecosystem unparalleled along our coast line.  There I have kayaked and painted some of the natural beauty. Additionally the Santa Barbara channel, connecting with our coast line and Channel Islands, holds its own value in preserving ecosystems for so many marine creatures including our migratory whale and bird populations. 

It is of supreme value to me that not only our generation, but the generations to follow, will be able to rely on the fertility of our coastal waters, and know that they are protected for posterity from historically harmful impacts of over-commercialization, waste and chemical dumping, drilling, and over-fishing. 

I am writing to express my individual views on the importance of acting now to protect and preserve, not only the cultural value of our coast in respect of the Chumash peoples’ heritage, but also protecting the variety of the marine life species which depend on these coastal regions.

I encourage you to utilize the opportunity we have before us now to link this Marine sanctuary to the Goleta  area, to extend the protection to the widest area possible. I also request you to regulate applications for transmission of generated energy, from wind turbines, via special use permit, which will allow specific review of impact, thus assuring that the water quality, marine mammal habitats, and added technology would be held in harmony. We cannot afford any more of our precious Natural world‘s balance to be permanently disrupted; your responsive actions are critical now to avoid  later wish that we had taken greater care. This is the time when we can designate a valuable and significant protection which will have a lasting positive affect, while still allowing for human needs to be met sustainably. 

Thank you for considering the health of our Oceans, recognizing that our  health is intimately intertwined with that of the ocean. This knowledge has been embraced by the Chumash people even us it is felt, known and respected by people of all heritages. Please act no to extend them Marine sanctuary to the widest possible length and breadth. Thank you. ",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

I’d like to submit my public comment for inclusion into the discussion about a proposed marine sanctuary off the coast of Central California.

While initially I was hesitant to support a marine sanctuary in the Morro Bay region, I’ve come to see it as a positive, to possibly help establish some localized control over what uses this area may serve.  It is our traditional fishing zone, and home to many important species and habitats.

To attempt to name the sanctuary after one cultural of indigenous people, the Chumash, without including the other primary indigenous culture, the people now know as Salinans, is not only a serious act of disrespect, it is actually a direct effort to make a claim on a territory by a splinter group of a non-profit organization that doesn’t hold any proven cultural affiliation to the pre-contact territory..

The original peoples of this coast didn’t identify themselves by today’s cultural names.  They didn’t own the land, but belonged to it, and associated with others who shared the ability to communicate through shared languages.  Living in smaller family groups, or tribelets, rather than villages, the three groups of different Salinan people  known today as the Antonio, the Migeulino, and the coastal Playano  lived for thousand of years and hundreds of generations, off the resources that were abundant and varies.  The greater Pacific Ocean was and remains a primary source of existence for these people, and we honor our ancestors by remaining its active children.  We belong to this land, this coast, this ocean, and ask that if a marine sanctuary is installed with the intent of protecting this region, that it is named so as to not disrespect the original people that still belong to it, and is managed in partnership to see that it serves the purpose on which it is established.

Sincerely,

I think it is important to designate the sanctuary using the initial boundaries proposed (Initial Boundary Alternative), plus the Gaviota Extension (sub-alternative 5b) in order to provide contiguous protection between Monterey Bay and Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuaries.
This area contains a rich, diverse marine environment, cultural resources such as submerged historic Chumash villages, and shipwrecks, all of which are deserving of protection.
Offshore wind transmission cables can be accommodated through a special use permit at a later date, but in the meantime, we must permanently protect the area from harmful activities like oil and gas development, seabed mining and dredging, and harmful polluting discharges to our waters.

The Chumash and other private and non-profit organizations should all have a voice in the protection of this immense resource on the Central Coast of California. We must do all we can to thwart the rapidly advancing effects of climate change and the establishment of a marine sanctuary is just one avenue to that end. This proposed sanctuary is a unique method to protect this rich marine environment home to diverse ecosystems and abundant wildlife including the beloved marine mammals that make the estuary located in Morro Bay their home. I am urging and encouraging you to include the entire coastline as originally proposed from the Channel Islands Marine Sanctuary to the south and the Monterey Bay Marine Sanctuary to the north. It makes no sense to exclude a huge amount of coastline from Morro Bay to Cambria and expect his sanctuary to fulfill the expected advantages proposed. That vast amount of coastline must be kept safe from oil drilling and other means to bring polluting industries to the area. I support the designation of the Initial Boundary Alternative with the Gaviota Coast Extension including the waters offshore of Point Buchon, Morro Bay, Cayucos and Cambria. This will protect the only eelgrass bed in a 300 mile stretch of coast including many historic Chumash sites. No other proposed sanctuary alternative is adequate to provide this protection. I also support the name ""Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary"" to honor the cultural history and stewardship of California Tribal peoples. I am also in favor of a Tribal Collaborative Management; please keep the sacred connection between our ocean and the community at the heart of this effort.

Hello,

My name is Phoenix Neuscheler, and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect the biodiversity and habitats in the area.

I live in Goleta, California, and to me, the ocean is an incredible part of our local environment, not to mention the entire world, and must be protected. The ocean's health is crucial to our planet's health, both the water that we swim in as well as the animals and plants that call the ocean home. This stretch of ocean must be protected so that my community can continue to connect with and benefit from a clean, safe, and healthy ocean for generations to come.

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary be named the ""Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary and that it includes collaborative management with all Tribes, a ban on all new oil and Gas developments in the area, as well as education and research programs that increase both Traditional Ecological Knowledge as well as access for local underserved communities.

I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

 

Sincerely,

My name is Olympia Auset, Founder at SÜPRSEED Inc., and I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I live in Los Angeles, CA and to me, the ocean is my matriach and provider.

I feel an intimate, inexplicable connection with water-- after all water is life. So it gives me joy to have a chance to keep the waters that give us life safe, clean, and beautiful while we still can! 

   
    The ocean is personally important to me. We depend on the ocean for recreation, our spiritual well-being, our community connections, and our economic health.

    I want to protect this stretch of ocean so my community can continue to connect with and benefit from a clean, safe, and healthy ocean.
    The ocean is beautiful and mysterious. There is so much we’ve learned from it and much more to be learned. A sanctuary will be an important part of ocean research and education for present and future generations.

Native people are the original healers and caretakers of this land and it is time space was returned to native communities so that land keepers can do their job. 

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes: 

    Biggest Possible Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension
    Sanctuary Name: The name “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”
    Tribal Collaborative Management: An equitable approach to include all Tribes in Collaborative Management.
    Outreach & Education: Outreach, education and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities
    Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount is essential to protect biodiversity
    A Ban on Oil & Gas: A prohibition on new oil and Gas development within sanctuary boundaries

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

I am a concerned citizen and a wildlife biologist.  I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats. 
I grew up in the South Bay Area of California.  Trips to the Coast were like entering a magical world. It brought the world alive for me, and taught me how interconnected our planet is. Since then, I've learned so much more about how unique and valuable these ecosystems are and how much they are in jeopardy. They should be preserved for the value of their biodiversity, ocean health, and even eco-tourism.  

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, and I ask that this sanctuary include the boundaries requested by the Chumash Tribe, to honor their history and the cultural importance of this area to the tribe.  I ask for the biggest possible boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with the Gaviota Coast Extension.

I am a commercial fisherwoman active in the area selected for the CHNMS. I adamantly opposed the proposed sanctuary. Sanctuary benefits to the ecosystem are unproven and the additional regulations are unnecessary as they already exist under multiple federal, state, and local laws. Removing the local influence over this area and placing decisions solely in the hands of the Sanctuaries management division of the federal government will be detrimental to the local culture especially the commercial fishermen as priority will be given to neo-Chumash cultural practices. Neo-Chumash culture misrepresents historical and factually proven evidence. The neo-Chumash are claiming ownership of areas in the sanctuary where their tribes do not have history. Please treat all cultural claims to the area equally. Fishermen deserve a say. There should have been a committee of locals advising on this project but instead, only the neo-Chumash have been consulted. There appears to be a clear political agenda driving this sanctuary's formation as the general public in the affected area does not want this to happen. Thank you for your time and consideration.

I strongly support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, with the largest contiguous boundaries: the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension, including Morro Rock/Lisamu’, and connecting to the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary.  I live in San Luis Obispo, California, where I and many others view this beautiful and important coastline and ocean as central to our lives. Protecting the Central Coast’s unique marine ecosystem is vital to the human and non-human species who depend on it. 

This designation is occurring in a time of rapid change and uncertainty. Much of the language in the regulatory documents focuses on codifying current conditions or reference those as a baseline, but our ecosystems are already at a crisis point and are evolving quickly. Novel problems and solutions that cannot be easily addressed or predicted - changes to the shoreline, erosion and sedimentation, species migration, the especially accelerated acidification of California’s coastal waters, and cascading impacts on rare and endangered species - are already in progress, and will profoundly impact the health of the ocean and our relationship to it. 

Collaborative and creative management to address these wicked challenges will be essential. To this end, I support the name Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to recognize the Indigenous peoples who have lived on this coast since time immemorial, and who are the best-suited to take a long, holistic view at the challenges the ocean faces now and in the future. I urge NOAA to sincerely engage in equitable collaborative management by creating a Tribal Sanctuary Advisory Council, including all local Tribal groups who would like to be involved, as well as a NOAA Tribal Liaison. Collaborative management will also be key for evaluating the complexity of offshore energy resources. Protecting biodiversity and habitats should be paramount in this process. I support the exploration of offshore wind energy and believe it need not be mutually exclusive with the Sanctuary: the monitoring and research possible through the Sanctuary designation will help ensure the reduction of adverse long-term impacts of such projects. Transmission cables proposed as part of future offshore wind developments should require permits from the National Marine Sanctuary Program to ensure they are sited with care to reduce these impacts. New oil and gas development within Sanctuary boundaries is environmentally irresponsible and should be prohibited. 

Finally, as a landscape architecture professional and educator, I strongly support multilingual and multicultural education and outreach for the Sanctuary that elevates both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities, to share information about local marine science, conservation, Indigenous history and culture, and human impacts and connections to marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Protecting the ocean for future generations requires the education, participation and stewardship of current generations. 

I offer deep gratitude to the Northern Chumash Tribal Council for their inspiring leadership in this effort; to their local partners the Marine Sanctuary Alliance, Santa Lucia Chapter of Sierra Club, SLO Chapter of Surfrider Foundation, COAST; to NOAA staff and leadership; and the many others who have worked tirelessly to bring the Sanctuary designation to this point. I strongly support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary and urge the Administration to immediately act to protect and honor this vital, special marine ecosystem of highest value for past, current and future generations.

As a Chumash person and a conservation biologist, I am happy to see this marine sanctuary being discussed. I am, however, very concerned and upset at NOAA's preferred alternative that removes Lisamu' (Morro Rock) and leaves it as a sacrifice zone to offshore wind development. NOAA recognizes that such activities will have large impacts to the marine environment and uses this as the reason for removing this area from the sanctuary, when in fact the opposite should be true. The fact that offshore wind development and the installation of cables will have such a large impact that it wouldn't be compatible with a marine sanctuary is all the more reason why this entire area needs the full protection of a sanctuary. Permitting processes exist for a reason, and any development should have to go through that process, rather than choosing to leave a large area vulnerable and lacking protections. I attended the virtual public comment meeting and saw the overwhelming support for the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to have the full original boundary with the addition of the Gaviota Coast Extension, with the only opposition coming from a few who stand to lose money from the designation. This sanctuary MUST cover the largest expanse possible to protect our ocean and the creatures living in it.

I am writing in strong support of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, designated with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

The ocean plays a critical role in our ecosystem, and thus in all of humanity's wellbeing by extension. Since the industrial revolution, we have been throwing caution to the wind by overfishing it, polluting it, and disrupting it through human-caused global warming, which we are now more commonly beginning to understand the dire impacts of on our collective lives. I believe it is about time to finally change course and start treating it with the respect that it deserves. 

As such, I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary:

1. Incorporates the biggest possible contiguous boundary, such that as much area is protected as possible. The Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension is the only option which accomplishes this, while also including benefits such as connecting it to the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary and including crucial cultural heritage sites.
2. Is named the “Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary”, which properly acknowledges the peoples who have watched over these waters and surrounding lands for most of our human history and who have been denied recognition in virtually every other way. 
3. Is managed collaboratively and equitably with local Tribal groups, who understand this area the best, and often in ways that the scientific lens historically is slow to agree with. 
4. Prohibits new oil and gas development within the sanctuary boundaries. Needless to say that global society cannot afford to burn more fossil fuels if we want to curb the worst effects of the climate crisis, and adding to our existing supply is at odds with that goal.
5. Pushes back against proposals to develop offshore wind within the sanctuary bounds when there are more suitable and optimal areas for such projects. The impacts of offshore wind on marine life and ecosystem health are not yet understood, so it does not make sense to experiment with such projects in locations where marine ecosystem health is crucial. 
6. Protects the Rodriguez Seamount, as it is a critical habitat for an abundant and diverse array of life. 
7. Supports outreach, education, and research programs that elevate both Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and access for local underserved communities. While honoring Tribal knowledge via the sanctuary name is important, so is actively engaging US citizens with real tribal community members to center their voices, share in their wisdom, and better understand their culture. Too long have indigenous communities suffered from erasure, othering, and violence; through our joined intention to protect and heal the Earth, we may be able to find ways to improve our nation's long-strained relationship with indigenous communities.

In short, I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, and I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from our ocean’s many treasures.

I am a longtime resident of San Luis Obispo County, California, who works as an Environmental Scientist at the California Department of Transportation. I have lived less than 2 miles from Pismo State Beach for approximately 20 years. My family and I place tremendous value on our local coastal and marine resources. I am writing to express my strong support for a Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary for the Pacific Ocean waters off the coasts of San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara Counties. I believe that you hold in your hands a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to extend permanent, meaningful protection to some of this nation's priceless natural resources on the West Coast. As you undoubtedly know, nationwide, National Marine Sanctuaries contribute roughly $8 billion a year to local coastal and ocean dependent economies across multiple sectors (NOAA, 2016). In San Luis Obispo County, ocean-based tourism and recreation are significant contributors to the local economy, employ many residents, and play a huge part in the general health and happiness of the population. There has been much discussion on whether it would be appropriate to designate a National Marine Sanctuary in an area planned for offshore wind energy development. I've participated in this discussion on a casual basis with friends and colleagues, and my take is that with strict controls/regulation, it would not be a dealkiller to include the potential wind energy area west of Morro Bay in the Sanctuary. On the contrary, I believe over the long term the benefits would outweigh any negatives and it would be a risk worth taking. I respectfully and explicitly ask that NOAA include that area in the proposed Sanctuary. Furthermore, I am aware there are disagreements between local tribal governments over the naming of the Sanctuary. Again, I believe that this Sanctuary designation would be overwhelmingly positive and beneficial for every stakeholder. It would be an absolutely foolish tragedy to let the opportunity slip away over prideful quibbling. Please work hard to bring the involved stakeholders to the table and hammer out a fair solution that honors and respects everyone. I am certain that this outcome is within reach. I'm not exaggerating when I say a very large proportion of Central Coast residents are depending on you to make the right decision for all our futures. Respectfully yours, (redacted).

RE: NOAA - National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) Section 106. - CHMS Designation


Dear NOAA Officials,

I hope this letter finds you well. I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to you for considering my thoughts and concerns regarding the proposed National Marine Sanctuary along the Central Coast of California. Your willingness to engage with community input and your endorsement of the Initial Boundary Alternative are greatly appreciated.

I support the formation of a new national sanctuary along the Central Coast of California. Although, as we navigate the establishment and management process of this sanctuary, it is of paramount importance that we do so with the utmost respect for the historical and cultural significance of the Salinan Tribe in the region. I would like to reiterate some key points summarizing my suggestions and concerns:

Recognition of Salinan Tribe's Significance: The ancestral bond that the Salinan Tribe shares with the proposed National Marine Sanctuary is profound. It is my fervent request that the significance of our tribe be recognized and celebrated alongside the historical presence of the Chumash in the region. Acknowledging both tribes' contributions is essential for an inclusive approach.

Boundary Establishment: I would like to express my strong opposition to any reduction in the sanctuary boundary, as proposed in the Initial Boundary Alternative. I believe that the initial  boundaries appropriately represent the cultural and historical landscape of the region, and any alterations would undermine the sanctity of the sanctuary.

Naming Tradition: I encourage the sanctuary's name to adhere to the tradition of using geographical features as its foundation. This approach preserves a deep connection to the region's natural and cultural heritage, which is essential for the preservation of our traditions and history.

Vetting Process for Tribal Representatives: To ensure authenticity in representation, I recommend that NOAA establish a vetting process for tribal representatives. Collaboration with the California Native American Heritage Commission would be a valuable step towards verifying ancestral and cultural connections to the Central Coast.

Consultation with Salinan and Chumash Peoples: I strongly advocate for the primary entities consulted regarding the sanctuary to be the Salinan and Chumash peoples. Recognizing our unique ties to the region is imperative in shaping a sanctuary that respects and celebrates our cultural heritage.

Representation for Non-Federally Recognized Tribes: It is crucial that non-federally recognized tribes are provided advisory capacity and opportunities for input. Additionally, culturally affiliated tribes should be adequately represented on the advisory council, taking into account the diverse tribal affiliations in the area.

In conclusion, I urge NOAA and all relevant authorities to give serious consideration to these recommendations. Inclusivity, respect for tribal heritage, and a fair representation of all stakeholders are fundamental principles that should guide the establishment and management of the National Marine Sanctuary along the Central Coast of California.

Thank you once again for your receptiveness to community input and for taking these concerns into account during the decision-making process. I look forward to seeing a sanctuary that reflects the rich tapestry of our cultural and natural history while ensuring its long-term preservation for generations to come.

Sincerely,
Jessica Rodgers

RE: Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary designation (NOAA-NOS-2021-0080)

Dear Mr. Michel:

I, Jennifer Fields, strongly support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary (CHNMS) to protect ocean biodiversity and to advance environmental justice through collaborative ocean management. 

I am a marine ecologist with over 10 years of experience studying the impacts of climate on marine and near-shore ecosystems. I believe that designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, spanning over 7,500 square miles of ocean and 156 miles of coastline, will be both beneficial for the environment, local communities and the economy. 

It is vital that the CHNMS cover the largest possible contiguous boundaries. I support designation of the Initial Boundary Alternative with the Gaviota Coast Extension (Sub-Alt 5b). Including the waters offshore Point Buchon, Morro Bay, Cayucos, and Cambria will close the California Central Coast’s biodiversity protection gap between Monterey Bay and Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuaries. This will protect the only eelgrass bed in a 300-mile stretch of coast; many historic Chumash sites, including Lisamu’ (Morro Rock); numerous protected marine mammals and shorebirds; the highest population of Southern Sea otters on the California coast; several State Marine Conservation Areas; and the kelp forests and rocky intertidal habitats considered to be some of the most diverse and abundant in the world.

In addition I support:
Equitable inclusion of all Central Coast Tribes in collaborative management. All sanctuary stakeholders will benefit from Indigenous input. The CHNMS is an opportunity to advance environmental justice efforts. Equitable collaborative management must be open to all Tribal groups interested in participating. This can best be accomplished with a Tribal Sanctuary Advisory Council made up of interested Tribal Groups. NOAA’s Tribal collaboration should be facilitated by a qualified Tribal Liaison. 
Compensation and resource support (e.g. childcare resources, flexible meeting times, accessibility accommodations, etc.) for Tribal and Indigenous community members for participation in engagement and collaborative management. Official designation will ensure the full benefits and expertise of NOAA and the Indigenous community are available to steward this important habitat, but equity and principles of co-management must be included in the process from designation onward.
Sanctuary education and community outreach programs should operate in partnership with area schools to increase education and access to the ocean for local communities. Programs should focus on both ocean ecology and Tribal history and culture. Outreach should be multilingual and multicultural, and prioritize underserved communities, such as the inland communities of Guadalupe and Santa Maria. This component is especially important as Indigenous communities on the Central Coast and throughout California have been forced away from their traditional lands along the coastline and onto inland reservations. Promoting access and education to traditional Indigenous lands, waters, and ways of knowing is a critical social component of sanctuary designation and education. 
Prioritize nature-based solutions within the Climate Action Plan and meaningful community engagement
Development of research programs that address the impacts of climate change, encourage community science, and elevate the use of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) to enhance ecosystem-based management. The Sanctuary should teach the benefits of protecting our ocean and planet and promote the spirit of stewardship that is exemplified by the culture and history of the original Chumash caretakers. 
The National Marine Sanctuary Program should work closely with state and federal partners, Offshore wind (OSW) companies, Tribes, and community members to ensure future OSW is developed in the most environmentally and culturally responsible manner.
The CHNMS is an exceptional opportunity to advance the first Tribally-nominated national marine sanctuary designation in the United States, setting a precedent for elevating Indigenous perspectives, cultural values in ocean conservation, and collaborative management that includes all Central Coast Tribes. The designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary will be an unprecedented accomplishment, honoring the history and culture of Native Americans, the Chumash people, and their ancestors who inhabited this region for more than 10,000 years. Indigenous co-management is a key climate solution for addressing and adapting to the impacts of climate change.

Thank you for moving the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary forward in this process and for reviewing these comments.

Sincerely,
Jennifer Fields",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

I've always had a profound connection to the ocean, and I'd like to share my perspective on a critical issue that often goes unnoticed. I consider myself a passionate environmentalist and an avid surfer, while my partner is a daring big wave surfer. Together, we're also parents to two young children, and it's important for us to emphasize the role of personal watercraft (PWC) in ensuring our safety, a factor that has become increasingly significant in our lives.

My own experiences as a surfer have deepened my appreciation for the ocean, and the Chumash sanctuary encompasses several perilous winter big wave surfing locations, known for their challenging and remote conditions. In these demanding and dangerous areas, PWCs have become indispensable tools for the safety of surfers. They not only play a vital role in rescuing surfers after falls but also in swiftly navigating through potentially hazardous situations. In emergencies such as shark encounters, drownings, or injuries, PWC operators serve as the first responders, making them absolutely essential to our safety. This concern resonates with many local surfers, big wave surfers like my partner, and families like ours who cherish both the thrill of the waves and the well-being of our loved ones.

It's also important to highlight that most surfers in our community share a deep commitment to environmental conservation. We're acutely aware of the rich wildlife and marine mammals in these waters, and we are wholeheartedly dedicated to preserving the natural beauty of the ocean and all its inhabitants. As a passionate water enthusiast, surfer, environmentalist, and parent, I firmly believe it's crucial for decision-makers to take into account the safety needs of our community and the responsible use of this area while discussing the sanctuary designation.

First for some basic background, I remind you all that it was a clear scientifically-based conclusion that it would be best for natural biological resources for there to be NO INTERRUPTION between the Monterey Bay NMS and the Channel Islands NMS.  Thus to meet this criteria, the northern portion of the proposed Chumash Heritage NMS should be included within the designated NMS boundaries – whatever the debate about tribal naming disagreements.

It is my understanding that the initial proposed map for marine sanctuary designation extended all the way through Santa Barbara County coastal areas.  Yet apparently the nominating map submitted did not extend (southeast) beyond the mouth area of Gaviota Creek.  I applaud the agencies for realizing the wisdom of the inclusion of the Gaviota Coastal Extension in the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary proposal and for submitting that essentially preferred alternative.  This is important due to the incredible marine diversity of that South Coast region including in the greater Naples area, as well as due to the significance to the Chumash tribe of some important historic villages and sacred sites in that area.  (I would hope that various oil operations including an onshore pipeline which has leaked in recent years would not be grandfathered in upon establishment of the Chumash (or whatever it shall be named) Heritage National Marine Sanctuary.

I am pleased that all alternatives (except for the No Action Alternative) include the greater Rodriguez Seamount area for some protections under a NMS designation.

I want to point out a key area north of the Rodriguez Seamount which is the Arguello Canyon / Arguello Terrace area.  I pointed out in earlier comments in this NMS process that it is important to protect natural and indigenous artifacts in this area not only because the Chumash used to live in this region before the ocean rose, but also because this is the area where the 2000 km Murray Fracture Zone meets the North American continent in the Santa Barbara County area.  Note that Point Arguello juts furthest west of the North American land mass, and (obviously due to the name alone) there is the notable Arguello Terrace and then Arguello Canyon.  I support an alternative which includes more rather than less of Arguello Canyon partly because it is the mapped region to my knowledge which is most related to the grander seismic perspective of the less-studied east-west oceanic fracture zone – the Murray Fracture Zone.

I am extremely disappointed in Alternatives 3 and 4 since they clearly do not realize (or care about) the significant biological and aesthetic resources in the Montana de Oro State Park and Diablo Canyon area.  How dare they want to turn the loveliest coastal park south of Big Sur into a mere electronic cable transmission route!  Surely the relatively undisturbed (except for increased carcinogenic threat from radioactivity and heavy metal releases in the Diablo Cove / Diablo Canyon area) and astoundingly beautiful Montana de Oro and Diablo Canyon should not become further sacrifice zones!  Do not route electric cables related to wind energy to this area!  

I am happy that more sane alternatives do include Montana de Oro and Diablo Canyon within the NMS zone offering certain protections.  While on one hand because (when they can keep the old creaker running) Diablo Canyon does generate energy and those power lines run toward the San Joaquin Valley, I can see how some got the idea to route it through that area despite its largely pristine nature.  However, the spent fuel rod assemblies at Diablo Canyon are overstuffed into thin untransportable canisters, and will pose a major threat at least until they may possibly be able to moved sometime perhaps early in the 22nd century.  I respect workers more than to have more contaminated because they are trying to route more alternatively-generated energy through electric cables at Diablo Canyon.  Have you examined various theorized Diablo Canyon reactor potential shutdown dates to gauge which might work best if wind energy did come into Diablo Canyon to use those cables?

I am pleased with Alt. 5 b with the exception of a few activities which may be grandfathered in during the establishment of this NMS.  I also support Alt. 5 a.  Just because some want to mess a lot with Morro Bay to have it become one of two main wind energy hubs in California does not mean its tidal-influenced estuary could not be included within the Chumash Heritage NMS boundaries.


Thanks for your attention, and protect a good amount including Gaviota Coast Extension.

Sincerely yours,

Bruce Campbell

I am Dr. Allyson Dallmann and live in Cambria. It is short-sighted and offensive that you would consider excluding the area between my home and Point Buchon. Our area is vital for biodiversity and provides essential connectivity for many species. It is a sanctuary not only for the animals who live here but for all of us who appreciate nature in her purest form. I love walking this area with my dogs and bring friends and family here so they can appreciate the serenity and wildlife.  We are deeply connected to this area BECAUSE OF THE WILDLIFE AND because it is unadulterated.  This plan would hurt the animals, habitat and all of us. Our oceans are warming, becoming more toxic from human activity and we have fewer animals here than we used to, so I feel you are directly targeting marine life, me and my wellbeing along with so many others including indigenous people in leaving this precious area out.   
We know how destructive oil and gas are so they must be banned from this area as well as cables for wind. (1)
As noted in “Oil in the Sea III: Inputs, Fates, and Effects.”
“Oil in the sea from anthropogenic sources, whether from spills or chronic releases, is perceived as a major environmental problem. Major oil spills occur occasionally and receive considerable public attention because of the obvious attendant environmental damage, including oil-coated shorelines and dead or moribund wildlife, especially oiled seabirds and marine mammals. Acute effects may be of short duration and limited impact, or they may have long-term population- or community-level impacts depending on the timing and duration of the spill and the numbers and types of organisms affected. Oil also enters the sea when small amounts are released over long periods, thus creating chronic exposure of organisms to oil and its component chemical species. Sources of chronic exposures include point sources, such as natural seeps, leaking pipelines, offshore production discharges, and non-point runoff from land-based facilities. In these cases, there may be a strong gradient from a high to a low oil concentration as a function of distance from the source. In other cases, such as with land-based runoff and atmospheric inputs, the origin of the oil is a nonpoint source, and environmental concentration gradients of oil compounds may be weak. Chronic exposures may also result from the incorporation of spilled oil into sediments in which weathering of oil is retarded, and from which nearly-fresh oil may be released to the water column over extended periods. In recent years, it is the long-term effects of acute and chronic pollution that have received increasing attention (Boesch et al., 1987).” (2)
Wind farms would disrupt migrating whales and other species, detrimentally alter habitats, decrease species survival, discharge contaminants further harming wildlife and their homes and they’re noisy. Would you want this to happen in your home? 
Sea mining is detrimental to the wildlife and environment as well (3). 
The Rodriguez Seamount must be protected for biodiversity.  

 Please designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative including the Gaviota Coast Extension- 7,600 square miles -to protect our wildlife already struggling due to anthropogenic causes as well as our living ocean and sanctuary in the broadest sense of the word. 
“Above all, do no harm.” I learned this credo in veterinary medicine, and it is apropos in any situation where coexistence, the environment, land, air and water are affected.  It is your responsibility to “do no harm” especially when we are in the sixth extinction crisis, and it is anthropogenic!  We must accept responsibility for our actions and prevent further harm to our wildlife, ecosystems and ourselves as we all share this one planet.

Chan School of Public Health",,,,,,"Dear Paul Michel,

I support the swift designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary with the Initial Boundary Alternative and Gaviota Coast Extension to cover about 7,600 square miles of ocean proposed to protect biodiversity and habitats.

I am a doctoral candidate at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, where I research the direct role that healthy ecosystems have in preventing asthma and allergies in kids. My decision to pursue this subject is inextricably tied to the fact that I grew up in Goleta and was so incredibly fortunate to benefit from the many nature preserves that surround Santa Barbara. Interacting with the vibrant natural space of the central coast is fundamental to my decision to pursue research of the relationship between human and ecological health, and is why I am proud to wholeheartedly support the designation of the Chumash Hertiage National Marine Sanctuary. 

Not only does safeguarding these ecosystems protect the beauty and biodiversity of our coast, this preservation of biodiversity in turn has cascading effects that protect the health of human populations that live nearby and spend time in natural environments. Our individual microbiomes - which are increasingly recognized as a critical supporter of our bodies' ability to fight disease and reduce the impact of poor diet, exposure to air pollution, and mental stress - are directly connected to the bacterial composition of the external biosphere around our bodies. As we eat, breathe, and move through our environment, the microbiome in our gut, lungs, and on our skin is engaged in a constant process of exchange with the broader environment. A healthy environment provides us with mircoorganisms that our bodies can incorporate into our healthy functioning, draw upon in the event of disease, and (especially when we're young) use to help our bodies determing which things are dangerous (e.g. germs) and which things are not (e.g. pollen). Without microbial diversity in the larger environment, as is common in many urbanized settings, kids are placed at higher risk of developing allergies and asthma because their bodies do not get enough ""training"" to differentiate between germs and allergens. 

Safeguarding biodiversity at the macro-level (think algae, kelp, dolphins, seals, starfish, whales - everything we can see with our eyes unassisted) is critical to make sure that our own microbiomes remain diverse and functional, in turn helping the body develop strong immune systems (especially for kids). This understanding of how humans' health and microbiome is linked to the macro-level biodiversity is just barely emerging, but has immense implications for the economic cost of health systems and disease that are not yet accounted for (to my knowledge) as possible benefits of safeguarding these biological reserves. 

From my position as a researcher and someone who spent the first 20 years of my life in the Central Coast, I cannot underscore emphatically enough how important it is to take drastic measures to preserve the wider network of life in California. It is not just a question of preserving beauty, or dollars from tourists, or cultural heritage (although those things are important) - it is also a question of safeguarding the health of humans, which depends on the land-sea biosphere's stability in ways which we are just beginning to understand. 

I support the designation of the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary. I ask that this sanctuary includes all the aspects as proposed by the Chumash Sanctuary campaign, including the largest possible boundaries (including, critically, the Gaviota Coast Extension), the proposed name of ""Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary,"" a equitable approach to include all Tribes in a collaborative management process, elevation of vital traditional ecological knowledge and access to the reserve for all along the central coast, the protection of Rodriguez Seamount, and a strict prohibition of new oil and gas developments within the boundaries of the sanctuary. 
    
I urge the Administration to designate the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary to allow current and future generations to enjoy, protect, and benefit from the stunning beauty of the marine environment along the Central Coast. 

 
Sincerely,

Ryan Dalforno",,,,,,,"pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

There is abundant scientific evidence that marine protected areas with robust protections, such as federal sanctuaries, have multiple benefits, including: 1) safeguarding biodiversity and protecting at-risk species and habitats; 2) increasing the resilience of marine ecosystems to climate change; 3) increasing the commercial and recreational fishing catches in surrounding areas; and 4) providing economic benefits that support healthy coastal communities. 
Furthermore, creating networks of marine protected areas leverages their individual benefits. Thus, in bridging the gap between the marine reserves to its north and south (offshore of San Luis Obispo County and Santa Barbara County, respectively) the proposed sanctuary will strengthen and build on their benefits.
The draft EIS does an exemplary job of listing and describing the rich and abundant ecological and other qualifications for the proposed area. Arguably the area's most unique feature is that it includes the meeting place of currents from relatively cold northern waters meet with warmer southern offshore waters. The resulting intermingling produces an altogether unique and valuable asset to our national marine biodiversity. 
Finally, the wholesale recognition and respect of tribal and Indigenous cultures of communities across our country is long overdue, and sanctuary-related collaborations with these peoples would begin to redress the harm done. 
It is widely acknowledged that less than 3% of the ocean is effectively protected. Experts from diverse disciplines believe that humans need to protect at least 30% of the ocean to safeguard marine biodiversity and build ocean resilience. A Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary is a superb addition to the world ocean's official ""family jewels.""

Our students and their families live, play, work and learn on land that overlooks this proposed protected waterway. My students surf, swim, ""beach,"" and fish in the coastal waters of the proposed CHMNS. In fact, the October 12 information meeting was held at our school site. Because my students care deeply about the ocean they see everyday and will be affected by any changes to the coastal waters, I decided to use the call for comments as an assignment for my students, asking them to share their opinions in a letter to the NOAA. We read the press release and watched the video on the project and they wrote responses. I've attached their letters here, as I promised them I would. Please note that for their privacy, I did not include their last names or identifying information. Also, please note that the opinions stated are theirs alone and do not represent the school, myself or the district. Last, I have unfortunately been recovering from a medical issue for the last two weeks and nearly missed the submission deadline completely. Upon realizing it was due today, I scrambled to find my students' letters and realized that I left their final drafts at school. So, the letters you are reading are their rough drafts, with editing ideas and marks from each other.

I support the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary because it is imperative to protect our wildlife and marine ecosystems.

My whole life I have loved the ocean and I can’t imagine a world where the ocean doesn’t hold the depth of wonder and life that it has nurtured since before our time as humans. The life within the ocean is worth protecting and worth protecting well. 

I think there should be the biggest possible boundary, including the Gaviota Coast Extension, because animals should be protected anywhere that they may be existing or migrating. There should absolutely be an equitable approach to include all Tribes in collaborative management and those Tribes should also be involved in Outreach and Education. Oil and gas should be banned within sanctuary boundaries after numerous spills that reveal the harm and damage these practices can inflict on marine life. 

Thank you for listening to our voices. I have included a sample of the voluntarily written letters from my third grade students, who adore the ocean and all its life. They were not told what to write, just that there was a question about whether we should protect the ocean and that there was the idea to have a sanctuary in order to do that. I hope the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary does become a reality so we can protect the ocean and continue to experience its wonders. 

Sincerely,
Leah Kaplan

Sanctuary Boundary: The Initial Boundary Alternative with Gaviota Coast Extension.   
	This is absolutely imperative for a contiguous NMS band along our Ca Coast, as well as protection to the edge of the continental plate - which in turn will offer protection to the upwelling process.
Outreach and Education: Outreach, education and research programs that help our locals, our children, our visitors understand the importance of our oceans and our actions to protect them.  As well as the problems we are causing for the oceans and all that live there.
Rodriguez Seamount: The protection of Rodriguez Seamount - this is an unique habitat that likely holds many new species for us to discover
Offshore Wind: Thoughtful planning of Offshore Wind farms to protect ocean life and migrating birds, bats, and insects (as we are seeing the numbers of all of there categories and species decline.). I am a supporter of the transition to sustainable.  But we need to know how to do so in an environmentally sound way.  Humans have an amazing history of significantly significant unintended consequences that negatively effect our environment.  It is much easier to protect  than it is to restore habitat and ecosystems.  
Also, I feel there has not been full transparency re other BOEM leases in the original proposed NMS boundaries - that have clearly driven the development of other boundary alternatives.   I have attached the BOEM maps that clearly shows this secondary lease area .
Water Quality: A prohibition on new oil development within sanctuary boundaries.  Also a prohibition on mining of minerals.",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/NOAA-NOS-2021-0080-3446/attachment_1.pdf","pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"

Thank you again for the opportunity to comment on the proposed Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary, which I urge you to designate as soon as possible with the largest possible boundaries (the Initial Boundary Alternative plus the Gaviota Coast Extension and the Morro Bay Estuary). 

A 2018 BOEM map of Central California call areas (attached) indicates that, over time, there could be an even larger development of wind energy in the Diablo Canyon call area. The potential effects of such a large development, especially if combined with the Morro Bay call area, are unknown. 

Such developments have the potential to damage the marine upwelling itself, the source of the biodiversity that makes this entire area worthy of protection as a national marine sanctuary. This potential makes designating the widest possible area as a national marine sanctuary even more crucial. As a nation, we must engage in wind-energy development in a way that addresses environmental issues and concerns thoughtfully and thoroughly. 

Thank you for your efforts to protect our irreplaceable natural and cultural heritage.

Sincerely,

Carol Blaney, MS, MS

I say this because it will only extend northwards to within approximately 2.5 miles of the southern end of Morro Bay Wind Energy Area.  Yet, the destruction from this wind project to regional fisheries, marine life and avian species will extend for hundreds of miles.  The public would know this if wind energy developers and our government hadn’t been hiding catastrophic impacts associated with wind energy projects for decades. 
The Channel Islands, miles away and critically important to seabirds, will not be protected by the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary from Morro Bay Wind. These colonies of seabirds will be decimated like the seabird colonies in the UK have from offshore wind. Migrating species, will also not be protected.",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/NOAA-NOS-2021-0080-3448/attachment_1.pdf","pageCount, Page Count, Number of pages In the content file"
