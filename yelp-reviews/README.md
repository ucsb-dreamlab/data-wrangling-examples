# Yelp Reviews

Yelp provides an open dataset for academic use. You can download it [here](https://www.yelp.com/dataset/download). In this example, python is used to print the business names and IDs in the open dataset, and to extract reviews for a business using its ID.

Thes example assumes the data has been downloaded, uncompressed, and saved in a directory called `yelp_dataset`. You should have the following files

```
